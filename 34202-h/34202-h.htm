<p class='c fs12'>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> we leave the world&#8217;s busy haunts and
penetrate the primal solitude of a vast wilderness,
a new realm peopled by mystic genii opens to us.
Each sombre gorge, where twisted roots clasp the
moss-coated walls, discloses fabled gnomes and
dryads. Nymphs and naiads outline their shadowy
forms in the mist of every cascade. Elfin
sprites dance in the ripples of a laughing brook,
and brownies scamper away over the leaf-swept
hilltops.</p>

<p>A wondrous Presence, multiform, omnipresent,
and ever fascinating, meets us on every hand, and
there in those magic aisles and sombre glades,
where man seems far away and God very near,
Nature sits enthroned.</p>

<p>It is with the hope that a few of my readers
may feel this forest-born mood, and in its poetic
spirit forget worldly cares, that I have written the
story of &#8220;The Girl from Tim&#8217;s Place.&#8221;</p>

<p class='fs16 c'>PART I<br />CHIP MCGUIRE</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Chip</span> was very tired. All that long June day,
since Tim&#8217;s harsh, &#8220;Come, out wid ye,&#8221; had roused
her to daily toil, until now, wearied and disconsolate,
she had crept, barefoot, up the back stairs to
her room, not one moment&#8217;s rest or one kindly
word had been hers.</p>

<p>Below, in the one living room of Tim&#8217;s Place,
the men were grouped playing cards, and the medley
of their oaths, their laughter, the thump of
knuckles on the bare table, and the pungent odor
of pipes, reached her through the floor cracks.
Outside the fireflies twinkled above the slow-running
river and along the stump-dotted hillside.
Close by, a few pigs dozed contentedly in their
rudely constructed sty.</p>

<p>A servant to those scarce fit for servants, a menial
at the beck and call of all Tim&#8217;s Place, and laboring
with the men in the fields, Chip, a girl of almost
sixteen, felt her soul revolt at the filth, the brutality,
the coarse existence of those whose slave she was.</p>

<p>And what a group they were!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>First, Tim Connor, the owner and master of this
oasis in the wilderness, sixty miles from the nearest
settlement; his brother Mike, as coarse; their
wives and a half a dozen children who played with
the pigs, squealed as often for food, and were left
to grow up the same way; and Pierre Lubec, the
hired man, completed the score.</p>

<p>There was another transient resident here, an
old Indian named Tomah, who came with the snow,
and deserted his hut below on the river bank when
spring unlocked that stream.</p>

<p>Two occasional visitors also came here, both
even more objectionable to Chip than Tim and his
family. One was her father, known to her to be
an outlaw and escaped murderer in hiding; the
other a half-breed named Bolduc, but known as One-eyed
Pete, a trapper and hunter whose abode was a
log cabin on the Fox Hole, ten miles away. His
face was horribly scarred by a wildcat&#8217;s claws;
one eye-socket was empty; his lips, chin, and protruding
teeth were always tobacco-stained. For
three months now, he had made weekly calls at
Tim&#8217;s Place, in pursuit of Chip. His wooing, as
might be expected, had been a persistent leering at
her with his one sinister eye, oft-repeated innuendoes
and insinuations of lascivious nature, scarce understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
by her, with now and then attempted familiarity.
These advances had met with much the
same reception once accorded him by the wildcat.</p>

<p>Both these visitors were now with the group
below. That fact was of no interest to Chip, except
in connection with a more pertinent one&#8211;a
long conference she had observed between them
that day. What it was about, she could not guess,
and yet some queer intuition told her that it concerned
her. Ordinarily, she would have sought
sleep in her box-on-legs bed; now she crouched on
the floor, listening.</p>

<p>For an hour the game and its medley of sounds
continued; then cessation, the tramp of heavily
shod feet, the light extinguished, and finally&#8211;silence.
A few minutes of this, and then the sound
of whispered converse, low yet distinct, reached
Chip from outside. Cautiously she crept to her
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gif you one hunerd dollars now, for ze gal,&#8221;
Pete was saying, &#8220;an&#8217; one hunerd more when you
fotch her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s three hundred down, I&#8217;ve told ye, or we
don&#8217;t do business,&#8221; was her father&#8217;s answer, in
almost a hiss.</p>

<p>A pain like a knife piercing her heart came to Chip.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>&#8220;But s&#8217;pose she run away?&#8221; came in Pete&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, sixty miles to a settlement? You must
be a damn fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if she no mind me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, thrash her then; she&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I no gif so much,&#8221; parleyed Pete; &#8220;I gif you
one-feefty now, an&#8217; one hunerd when she come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll give what I say, and be quick about it,
or I&#8217;ll take her out to-morrow, and you&#8217;ll never see
her again; so fork over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you fotch her to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I told you.&#8221; And so the bargain was concluded.</p>

<p>Only a moment more, while Chip sat numb and
dazed, then came the sound of footsteps, as the two
men separated, and then silence over Tim&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>And yet, what a horror for Chip! Sold like a
horse or a pig to this worse than disgusting half-breed,
and on the morrow to be taken&#8211;no, dragged&#8211;to the half-breed&#8217;s hut by her hated father.</p>

<p>Hardly conscious of the real intent and object
of this purchase, she yet understood it dimly. Life
here was bad enough&#8211;it was coarse, unloved, even
filthy, and yet, hard as it was, it was a thousand
times better than slavery with such an owner.</p>

<p>And now, still weak and trembling from the shock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
she raised her head cautiously and peeped out of the
window. A faint spectral light from the rising
moon outlined the log barn, the two log cabins, and
pigsty, which, with the frame house she was in, comprised
Tim&#8217;s Place. Above and beyond where the
forest enclosed the hillside, it shone brighter, and
as Chip looked out upon the ethereal silvered view,
away to the right she saw the dark opening into the
old tote road. Up this they had brought her, eight
years before. Never since had she traversed it;
and yet, as she looked at it now, an inspiration born
of her father&#8217;s sneer came to her.</p>

<p>It was a desperate chance, a foolhardy step&#8211;a
journey so appalling, so almost hopeless, she might
well hesitate; and yet, escape that way was her one
chance. Only a moment longer she waited, then
gathering her few belongings&#8211;a pair of old shoes,
the moccasins Old Tomah had given her, a skirt
and jacket fashioned from Tim&#8217;s cast-off garments,
a fur cap, and soft felt hat&#8211;she thrust them into
a soiled pillow-case and crept down the stairs.</p>

<p>Once out, she looked about, listened, then darted
up the hillside, straight for the tote road entrance.
Here she paused, put on her moccasins, and looked
back.</p>

<p>The moon, now above the tree-tops, shone full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
upon Tim&#8217;s Place, softening and silvering all its
ugliness and all its squalor. Away to the left stood
Tomah&#8217;s hut, across the river, a shining path bright
and rippled.</p>

<p>In spite of the awful dread of her situation and the
years of her hard, unpaid, and ofttimes cursed toil,
a pang of regret now came to her. This was her
home, wretched as it was. Here she had at least
been fed and warmed in winters, and here Old
Tomah had shown her kindness. Oh, if he were
only in his hut now, that she might go and waken
him softly, and beg him to take her in his canoe and
speed down the river!</p>

<p>But no! only her own desperate courage would
now avail, and realizing that this look upon Tim&#8217;s
Place was the last one, she turned and fled down the
path. Sixty miles of stony, bush-encumbered,
brier-grown, seldom-travelled road lay ahead of
her! Sixty miles of mingled swamp, morass, and
rock-ribbed hill! Sixty miles through the sombre
silence and persistent menace of a wilderness, peopled
only by death-intending creatures, yellow-eyed
and sharp-fanged!</p>

<p>With only a sickening, soul-nauseating fate
awaiting her at Tim&#8217;s Place, and her sole escape
this almost insane flight, she sped on. The faint,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
spectral rifts of moonlight through interlaced fir
and spruce as often deceived as aided her; bending
boughs whipped her, bushes and logs tripped
her, sharp stones and pointed sticks bit her; she
hurried over hillocks, wallowed through sloughs
and dashed into tangles of briers, heedless of all
except her one mad impulse to escape.</p>

<p>Soon the ever present menace of a wilderness
assailed her,&#8211;the yowl of a wildcat close at hand;
in a swamp, the sharp bark of a wolf; on a hillside
above her, the hoot of an owl; and when
after two hours of this desperate flight had exhausted
her and she was forced to halt, strange
creeping, crawling things seemed all about.</p>

<p>And now the erratic, fantastic belief of Old
Tomah returned to her. With him the forest
was peopled by a weird, uncanny race, sometimes
visible and sometimes not&#8211;&#8220;spites,&#8221; he called
them, and they were the souls of both man and
beast; sometimes good, sometimes evil, according
as they had been in life, and all good or ill
luck was due to their ghostly influences. They
followed the hunter and trapper day and night,
luring him into safety or danger, as they chose.
They were everywhere, and in countless numbers,
ready and sure to avenge all wrongs and reward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
all virtues. They had a Chieftain also, a great
white spectre who came forth from the north in
winter, and swept across the wilderness, spreading
death and terror.</p>

<p>Many times at Tim&#8217;s Place, Chip had sat enthralled
on winter evenings, while Old Tomah
described these mystic genii. They were so real
to him that he made them real to her, and now,
alone in this vast wilderness, spectral in the faint
moonlight and filled with countless terrors, they
returned in full force. On every side she could
see them, creeping, crawling, through the undergrowth
or along the interlaced boughs above her.
She could hear the faint hiss of their breath in
the night wind, see the gleam of their little eyes in
dark places&#8211;they were crossing the path in front
of her, following close behind, and gathering about
her from every direction.</p>

<p>Beneath bright sunlight, a vast wilderness is
at best a place peopled by many terrors. Its solitude
seems uncanny, its shadow fearsome, its
silence ominous. The creaking of limbs moving
in the breeze sounds like the shriek of demons;
the rush of winds becomes the hiss of serpents.
Vague terrors assail one on every hand, and the
rustle of each dry leaf, or breaking of every twig,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
becomes the footfall of a savage beast. We advance
only with caution, oft halting to look and
listen. A stern, defiant <i>Presence</i> seems everywhere
confronting us, and the weird mysticism of Nature
bids us beware. By night this invisible Something
becomes of monstrous proportions. Ghosts
fashion themselves out of each rift of light, and
every rock, thick-grown tree-top, or dark shadow
becomes a goblin.</p>

<p>To Chip, educated only in the fantastic lore
of Old Tomah, these terrors now became insanity-breeding.
She could not turn back&#8211;better
death among the spites than slaving to the half-breed;
and so, faint from awful fear, gasping
from miles of running, she stumbled on. And
now a little hope came, for the road bent down
beside the river, and its low voice seemed a word
of cheer. Into its cool depths she could at least
plunge and die, as a last resort.</p>

<p>Soon an opening showed ahead, and a bridge
appeared. Here, for the first time, on this vantage
point, she halted. How thrice blessed those
knotted logs now seemed! She hugged and patted
them in abject gratitude. She crawled to the
edge and looked over into the dark, gurgling
water. Up above lay a faint ripple of silver. Here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
also, she could see the moon almost at the zenith,
and a few flickering stars.</p>

<p>A trifle of courage and renewal of hope now
came. Her face and hands were scratched and
bleeding, clothing torn, feet and legs black with
mud. But these things she neither noticed nor
felt&#8211;only that blessed bridge of logs that gave
her safety, and the moon that bade her hope.</p>

<p>Then she began to count her chances. This
landmark told her that five miles of her desperate
journey had been covered and she was still alive.
She began to calculate. How soon would her
escape be discovered, and who would pursue her?
Only Pete, her purchaser, she felt sure, and there
was a possible chance that he might return to his
cabin before doing so. Or perhaps he might
sleep late, and thus give her one or two hours
more of time.</p>

<p class='center caption'>
All the goblin forms and hideous shapes of Old Tomah&#8217;s fancy were rushing and leaping about.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>And now she began to review the usual morning
movements at Tim&#8217;s Place&#8211;Tim the first
one up, calling her, then going out to milking;
the others, slower to arise, getting out and about
their special duties. Pete, she knew, always
slept in one of the two empty log cabins which
were first built there. Her father slept in the
other or in the barn. Neither would be called,
she knew&#8211;it was get around in time for breakfast
at Tim&#8217;s Place or go hungry. And so she
speculated on her chances of early pursuit. Here
on this bridge she now meant to remain until the
first sign of dawn, then push on again with all
speed. She already had a five-mile start, she was
weary, footsore, and still faint from the awful
terrors of her flight; to go on meant to rush
into the swarm of spites once more, and so she
lay inert on the hard logs watching, listening,
calculating.</p>

<p>And now cheered by this trifling hope and
lessening sense of danger, her past life came back.
Her childhood in a far-off settlement; the home
always in a turmoil from the strange men and
women ever coming and going; the drinking,
swearing, singing, at all hours of the night, her
constant fear of them and wonder who they were
and why they came. There were other features of
this disturbed life: frequent quarrels between her
father and mother; curses, tears, and sometimes
blows, until at last after a night more hideous than
any other her mother had taken her and fled. Then
came a long journey to another village and a new
life of peace and quietness. Here it was all so
different&#8211;no red-shirted men to be afraid of,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
no loud-voiced women drinking with them. She
became acquainted with other children of her
own age, was sent to school and taken to church.
Here, also, her mother began to smile once more,
and look content. For two years, and the only
ones Chip cared to recall, she had been a happy
schoolgirl, and then came a sudden, tragic end
to it all. Of that she never wished to think. It
was all so horrible, and yet so mercifully brief.</p>

<p>The one friend life held, her mother, had been
brought home, wounded to death amid the whirring
wheels of the mill where she worked; there
were a few hours of agonized dread as her life
ebbed away, a whisper or two of love and longing,
and then the sad farewell made doubly awful by
her father&#8217;s frowning face and harsh voice. At
its ending, and in spite of her fears and tears, she
was now borne away by him. For days they
journeyed deeper and deeper into a vast wilderness,
to halt at last at Tim&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>Like a dread dream it all came back now, as
she lay there on this one flat spot of security&#8211;the
bridge&#8211;and listened to the river&#8217;s low murmur.</p>

<p>The moon was lowering now. Already the
shadow of the stream&#8217;s bordering trees had reached
her. First the stars vanished, then the moon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
faded into a dim patch of light, finally that disappeared,
a chill breeze swept down from a neighboring
mountain, and the trees began to moan
and creak. Then a fiercer blast swept through
the forest, the great firs and spruces bent and
groaned and screamed. Surely the spites were
gathering in force again, and this was their doing.</p>

<p>Once more she began to hear them creeping,
crawling, over the bridge. They spit, they snarled,
they growled. The darkness grew more intense,
no longer could the river&#8217;s course be seen, but
only a black chasm.</p>

<p>All through her mad flight the wilderness had
been ghostly and spectral in the moonlight;
now it had become lost in inky blackness, yet
alive with demoniac voices. All the goblin
forms and hideous shapes of Old Tomah&#8217;s fancy
were rushing and leaping about. Now high up
in the tree-tops, now deep in the hollows, they
screamed and shrieked and moaned.</p>

<p>And now, just as this fierce battle of sound and
spectral shape was at its worst, and Chip, a hopeless,
helpless mite of humanity, crouched low
upon the bridge, suddenly a vicious growl reached
her, and raising her head she saw at the bridge&#8217;s
end two gleaming eyes!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Martin Frisbie</span> and his nephew Raymond
Stetson, or Ray, were cutting boughs and carrying
them to two tents standing in the mouth of
a bush-choked opening into the forest. In front
of this Angie, Martin&#8217;s wife, was placing tin dishes,
knives, and forks, upon a low table of boards.
Upon the bank of a broad, slow-running stream,
two canoes were drawn out, and halfway between
these and the table a camp-fire burnt.</p>

<p>Here Levi, Martin&#8217;s guide for many trips into
this wilderness, was also occupied, intently watching
two pails depending from bending wambecks,
a coffee-pot hanging from another, and two frying-pans,
whose sputtering contents gave forth an
enticing odor.</p>

<p>Twilight was just falling, the river murmured
in low melody, and a few rods above a small rill
entered it, adding a more musical tinkle.</p>

<p>Soon Levi deftly swung one of the pails away
from the flame with a hook-stick and speared a
potato with a fork.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>&#8220;Supper ready,&#8221; he called; and then as the rest
seated themselves at the table, he advanced, carrying
the pail of steaming potatoes on the hooked
stick and the frying-pan in his other hand.</p>

<p>The meal had scarce begun when a crackling
in the undergrowth back of the tent was heard,
and on the instant there emerged a girl. Her
clothing was in shreds, her face and hands were
black with mud, streaks of blood showed across
cheek and chin, and her eyes were fierce and sunken.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake give me suthin&#8217; to eat,&#8221; she
said, looking from one to another of the astonished
group. &#8220;I&#8217;m damn near starved&#8211;only a bite,&#8221;
she added, sinking to her knees and extending
her hands. &#8220;I hain&#8217;t eat nothin&#8217; but roots &#8217;n&#8217; berries
for three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angie was the first to recover. &#8220;Here,&#8221; she
said, hastily extending her plate, &#8220;take this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the starved creature grasped
it and began eating as only a desperate, hungry
animal would, while the group watched her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry so,&#8221; exclaimed Martin, whose
wits had now returned. &#8220;Here, take this cup of
coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon the food vanished and then the girl arose.
&#8220;Sit down again, my poor child,&#8221; entreated Angie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
who had observed the strange scene with moist
eyes, &#8220;and tell us who you are and where you
came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Chip,&#8221; answered the girl, bluntly,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; away from Tim&#8217;s Place, &#8217;cause
dad sold me to Pete Bolduc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold&#8211;you&#8211;to&#8211;Pete&#8211;Bolduc,&#8221; exclaimed
Angie, looking at her wide-eyed. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did, sartin,&#8221; answered the girl, laconically.
&#8220;I heerd &#8217;em makin&#8217; the bargain, &#8217;n&#8217; I fetched
three hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin and his wife exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and then what?&#8221; continued Angie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, then I waited a spell, till they&#8217;d turned
in,&#8221; explained the girl, &#8220;and then I lit out. I
knowed &#8217;twas sixty miles to the settlement, but
&#8217;twas moonlight &#8217;n&#8217; I chanced it. I&#8217;ve had an
awful time, though, the spites hev chased me all
the way. I was jist makin&#8217; a nestle when I seed
yer light, an&#8217; I crept through the brush &#8217;n&#8217; peeked.
I seen ye wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nobody from Tim&#8217;s Place, &#8217;n&#8217; then
I cum out. I guess you&#8217;ve saved my life. I was
gittin&#8217; dizzy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a brief, blunt story whose directness bespoke
truth; but it revealed such a pigsty state
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
of morality at this Tim&#8217;s Place that the little group
of astonished listeners could scarce finish supper
or cease watching this much-soiled girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so your name is Chip,&#8221; queried Angie
at last. &#8220;Chip what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chip McGuire,&#8221; answered the waif, quickly;
&#8220;only my real name ain&#8217;t Chip, it&#8217;s Vera; but
they&#8217;ve allus called me Chip at Tim&#8217;s Place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your father sold you to this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did, &#8217;n&#8217; he&#8217;s a damn bad man,&#8221; replied
Chip, readily. &#8220;He killed somebody once, an&#8217;
he don&#8217;t show up often. I hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t use swear words,&#8221; returned
Angie, &#8220;it&#8217;s not nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked abashed. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;d cuss
if you&#8217;d been sold to such a nasty-looking man as
Pete,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;He chaws terbaccer &#8217;n&#8217;
lets it drizzle on his chin, &#8217;n&#8217; he hain&#8217;t but one eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angie smiled, while Martin stared at the girl
with increased astonishment. He knew who this
McGuire was, and something of his history, and
that Tim&#8217;s Place was a hillside clearing far up the
river, inhabited by an Irish family devoted to the
raising of potatoes. He had halted there once,
long enough to observe its somewhat slothful condition,
and to buy pork and potatoes; but this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
tale was a revelation, and the girl herself a greater
one.</p>

<p>This oasis in the wilderness was fully forty miles
above here, its only connection with civilization
was a seldom-used log road which only an experienced
woodsman could follow, and how this
mere child had dared it, was a marvel.</p>

<p>But there she was, squat on the ground and
watching them with big black, pleading eyes.
There was but one thing to do, to care for her now,
as humanity insisted, and Angie made the first
move. It was in the direction of cleanliness; for
entering the tent, she soon appeared with some
of her own extra clothing, soap, and towels, and
bade the girl follow her up the river a few rods.</p>

<p>The moon was shining clearly above the tree-tops,
the camp-fire burned brightly, and Martin,
Ray, and Levi were lounging near it when the two
returned, and in one an astonishing transformation
had taken place.</p>

<p>Angie had gone away with a girl of ten in respect
to clothing, her skirt evidently made of gunny
cloth and reaching but little below her knees, and
for a waist, what was once a man&#8217;s red flannel
shirt, and both in rags. Soiled with black mud,
and bleeding, she was an object pitiable beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
words; she returned a young lady, almost, in
stature, her face shining and rosy, and her eyes so
tender with gratitude that they were pathetic.</p>

<p>Another change had also come with cleanliness
and clothing&#8211;a sudden bashfulness. It was
some time ere she could be made to talk again, but
finally that wore away and then her story came.
What a tale it was&#8211;scarce credible.</p>

<p>At first were growing terrors as she plunged
deeper and deeper into the shadowy forest, the
brush and logs that tripped her, the mud holes she
wallowed through, the ever increasing horrors of
this flight, the blood-chilling cries of night prowlers,
the gathering darkness while she waited on the
bridge, the awful moment when she saw two yellow
eyes watching her, not twenty feet away, her screams
of agonized fear, and then time that seemed eternity,
while she expected the next moment to feel
the fangs of a hungry panther.</p>

<p>How blessed the first dawn of morning had
seemed, how she ran on and on, until faint with
hunger she halted to eat roots, leaves, berries&#8211;anything
to sustain life! The river had been her
one boon of hope and consolation, and even beyond
the fear of wild beast had been the dread of pursuit
and capture by this half-breed. When night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
came, she had crept into a thicket, covering herself
with boughs; when daylight dawned, she had
pushed on again, ever growing weaker and oft
stumbling from faintness.</p>

<p>Hope had almost vanished, her strength had
quite left her, the last day had been a partial blank
so far as knowledge of her progress went, but
filled with eerie sights and sounds. From first to
last the spites of Old Tomah had kept her company&#8211;by day she heard them, swifter-footed than
she, in the undergrowth; by night they were all
about, dodging behind trees, hopping from limb
to limb, and sometimes snapping and snarling.
The one supreme moment of joy, oft referred to,
was when she had seen her rescuers&#8217; camp-fire,
with human, and possibly friendly, faces about it.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic, weird, almost spookish tale,&#8211;the
spectres she had seen were so real to her that
the telling made them seem almost so to the rest,
and beyond that, the girl herself, so like a young
witch, with her shadowy eyes and furtive glances,
added to the illusion.</p>

<p>But now came a diversion, for Levi freshened
the fire, and at a nod from Angie, Ray brought
forth his banjo. It was his one pet foible, and it
went with him everywhere, and now, with time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
and place so in accord, he was glad to exhibit his
talent. He was not an expert,&#8211;a few jigs and
plantation melodies composed his repertory,&#8211;but
with the moonlight glinting through the spruce
boughs, the river murmuring near, somehow
one could not fail to catch the quaint humor of
&#8220;Old Uncle Ned,&#8221; &#8220;Jim Crack Corn,&#8221; and the
like, and see the two dusky lovers as they floated
down the &#8220;Tombigbee River,&#8221; and feel the pathos
of &#8220;Nellie Grey&#8221; and &#8220;Old Kentucky Home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ray sang fairly well and in sympathy with each
theme. To Angie and the rest it was but ordinary;
but to this waif, who never before had heard
a banjo or a darky song, it was marvellous. Her
face lit up with keen interest, her eyes grew misty
at times, and once two tears stole down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>For an hour Ray was the centre of interest, and
then Angie arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Chip,&#8221; she said pleasantly, &#8220;it&#8217;s time
to go to bed, and you are to share my tent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; the girl replied bluntly. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t fit. I kin jist ez well curl &#8217;longside o&#8217; the
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Angie insisted and the girl followed her
into the tent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>Here occurred another incident that must be
related. Angie, always devout, and somewhat
puritanical, was one who never forgot her nightly
prayer, and now, when ready for slumber, she
knelt on the bed of fir twigs, and by the light of one
small candle offered her usual petition, while Chip
watched her with wide and wondering eyes. As
might be expected, that waif was mentioned, and
with deep feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye s&#8217;pose God heard ye?&#8221; she queried with
evident candor, when Angie ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; came the earnest answer;
&#8220;God hears all prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do the spites hear &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no such creatures as &#8216;spites,&#8217;&#8221; answered
Angie, severely; &#8220;you only imagine them,
and what this Indian has told you is superstition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em, hundreds on &#8217;em, big and
little,&#8221; returned the girl, stoutly.</p>

<p>Angie looked at her with pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that notion out of your head, once for
all,&#8221; she said, almost sternly. &#8220;It is only a delusion,
and no doubt told to scare you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And poor Chip, conscious that perhaps she had
sinned in speech, said no more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>For a long time Angie lay sleepless upon her
fragrant bed, recalling the waif&#8217;s strange story
and trying to grasp the depth and breadth of her
life at Tim&#8217;s Place; also to surmise, if possible,
how serious a taint of evil she had inherited. That
her father was vile beyond compare seemed positive;
that her mother might have been scarce better
was probable. No mention, thus far, had
been made of her; and so Angie reflected upon
this pitiful child&#8217;s ancestry and what manner of
heritage she had been blessed or cursed with.
Some of her attributes awoke Angie&#8217;s admiration.
She had shown utter abhorrence of this brutal
sale of herself, a marvellous courage in endeavoring
to escape it. She seemed grateful for what
had been done for her, and a partial realization of
her own unfitness for association with refined
people. Her speech was no worse than might be
expected from her life at Tim&#8217;s Place. Doubtless,
she was unable to read or write. And so Angie
lay, considering all the pros and cons of the situation
and of this girl&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>There was also another side to it all, the humane
one. They were on their way out of the wilderness,
for a business visit to the nearest settlement,
intending to return to the woods in a few days&#8211;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
what was to be done with this child of misfortune?</p>

<p>Most assuredly they must protect her for the
present. But was there any one to whom she
could be turned over and cared for? It seemed
possible this brutal buyer of her would follow her
out of the woods, to abduct her if found, and
then the moral side of this episode with all its
abominable possibilities occurred to Angie, who
was, above all, unselfish and noble-hearted. Vice,
crime, and immorality were horrible to her.</p>

<p>Here was a self-evident duty thrusting itself
upon her, and how to meet it with justice to herself,
her husband, and her own conscience, was a
problem. Thus dwelling upon this complex situation,
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>The first faint light of morning was stealing into
the tent when Angie felt her companion stir. She
had, exhausted as she doubtless was, fallen asleep
almost the moment she lay down; but now she was
evidently awake.</p>

<p>Curious to note what she would do, Angie remained
with closed eyes and motionless. From the corner
of the tent where she had curled up the night before,
the girl now cautiously crept toward the elder
woman. Inch by inch, upon the bed of boughs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
she moved nearer, until Angie, watching with half-open
eyes, saw her head lowered, and felt two soft
warm lips touch her hand.</p>

<p>It was a trifle. It was no more than the act of
a cat who rubs herself against her mistress or a dog
who licks his master&#8217;s hand, and yet it settled once
for all that waif&#8217;s fate and Angie&#8217;s indecision.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;Women are like grasshoppers&#8211;ye kin never tell which
way they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to jump.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Levi</span> was starting a fire, Ray washing potatoes,
and Martin, in his shirt-sleeves, using a towel
vigorously near the canoes, when Angie and Chip
emerged that morning; and now while breakfast
is under way, a moment may be seized to explain
who these people were and their mission in this
wilderness.</p>

<p>Many years before, in a distant village called
Greenvale, two brothers, David and Amzi Curtis,
had quarrelled over an unfortunate division of inherited
land. The outcome was that Amzi, somewhat
misanthropic over the death of his wife, and
of peculiar make-up, deserted his home and little
daughter Angeline, and vanished. For many years
no one knew of his whereabouts, and he was given
up as dead.</p>

<p>In the meantime his child, cared for by a kindly
woman known as Aunt Comfort, had grown to
womanhood. About this time a boyhood sweetheart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
of Angeline&#8217;s, named Martin Frisbie, who had
been gathering wealth in a distant city, invited a
former schoolmate, now the village doctor in Greenvale,
to join him on an outing trip into the wilderness.</p>

<p>Here something of the history of a notorious outlaw
named McGuire became known to Martin, and
more important than that, a queer old hermit was
discovered, dwelling in solitude on the shore of a
small lake. Who he was, and why this strange
manner of life, Martin could not learn, and not
until later, when he returned to Greenvale to woo
his former sweetheart once more, did he even guess.
Here, however, from a description furnished by a
village nondescript,&#8211;a sort of Natty Bumpo and
philosopher combined, known as Old Cy Walker,
who had been Martin&#8217;s youthful companion,&#8211;he
was led to believe that the queer hermit and the
long-missing Amzi were one and the same.</p>

<p>Another trip into this wilderness with Old Cy,
taken to identify the hermit, resulted in proving the
correctness of the surmise. Then Martin set about
making this misanthropic recluse more comfortable in
all ways possible; and then, leaving Old Cy to keep
him company, he returned to Greenvale and Angie.</p>

<p>A marriage was the outcome of his return to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
native village, and then, with his nephew, Ray, and
long-tried guide, Levi, as helpers on this unique
wedding trip, the hermit was visited.</p>

<p>It was hoped that meeting his child once more
would result in inducing him to abandon his wildwood
existence and to return to civilization; and
it did&#8211;partially. He seemed happy to meet his
daughter again, consented to return with them
when ready, and after a couple of weeks&#8217; sojourn
here, the canoes were packed and all set out for
civilization and Greenvale once more.</p>

<p>But &#8220;home, sweet home,&#8221; albeit it was, as in
this case, a lonely log cabin in a vast wilderness,
proved stronger than parental love or aught else;
and sometime during first night&#8217;s camp on the way
out, this strange recluse stole away in his canoe
and returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s natur,&#8221; Old Cy observed when morning
came, &#8220;an&#8217; home is the hardest spot in the world
to fergit. Amzi&#8217;s lived in that old shack all &#8217;lone
for twenty years. He&#8217;s got wonted to it like a dog
to his kennel, an&#8217; all the powers o&#8217; the univarse can&#8217;t
break up the feelin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed an indisputable, if disappointing, fact,
and Martin led his party back to the hermit&#8217;s home
once more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>Another plan was now considered by Martin&#8211;to
buy the township, or at least a large tract enclosing
this lake, build a more commodious log cabin for
the use of himself and his wife, and spend a portion
of each summer there. There were several reasons
other than those of affection for this decision.</p>

<p>This lake, perhaps half a mile in diameter, teemed
with trout. The low mountains enclosing it were
thickly covered with fine spruce and fir, groves of
pine with some beech and birch grew in the valleys;
deer, moose, and feathered game abounded here,
and best of all, no vandal lumbermen ever encroached
upon this region.</p>

<p>It was, all considered, a veritable sportsman&#8217;s
paradise. Most likely a few thousand dollars
would purchase it, and so, for these collective
reasons, Martin decided to buy it.</p>

<p>Old Cy was left to keep the hermit company;
Martin, his wife, and Ray, with Levi, started for
civilization to obtain needed supplies, and had
been four days upon the way when this much-abused
waif appeared on the scene. The party
were journeying in two canoes, one manned by
Ray, who had already learned to wield a paddle,
which carried the tents and luggage; while the
other was occupied by Martin, his wife, and Levi.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
The only available seat for the new arrival was in
Ray&#8217;s canoe, and when breakfast was disposed of
and the voyagers ready to start, she was given a
place therein.</p>

<p>The river at this point was broad and of slow
current, only two days&#8217; journey was needful to reach
the settlement, and no cause for worry appeared&#8211;but
Levi felt otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d best hug the futher shore,&#8221; he observed
to Ray quietly when the boy pushed off, &#8220;an&#8217;
don&#8217;t git out o&#8217; sight o&#8217; us.&#8221; &#8220;I ain&#8217;t sartin &#8217;bout
the outcome o&#8217; this matter,&#8221; he said to Martin later.
&#8220;I know that half-breed, Bolduc, and he&#8217;s a bad
&#8217;un. From the gal&#8217;s story he paid big money fer
her. He don&#8217;t know the meanin&#8217; o&#8217; law, and if
he follers down the tote road, as I callate he will,
&#8217;n&#8217; ketches sight o&#8217; her, the first we&#8217;ll know on&#8217;t &#8217;ll
be the crack o&#8217; a rifle. The wonder to me is he
didn&#8217;t ketch her &#8217;fore she got to us. He could track
her faster&#8217;n she could run. I don&#8217;t want to &#8217;larm
you folks, but I shan&#8217;t feel easy till we&#8217;re out o&#8217; the
woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t reassuring.</p>

<p>But no thought of this came to Ray, at least,
and these two young people, yielding to the magic
of the morning, the rippled river that bore them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
onward, the birds singing along the fir-clad banks,
and all the exhilaration of the wilderness, soon
reached the care-free converse of youthful friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had nothin&#8217; but work &#8217;n&#8217; cussin&#8217;,&#8221; Chip
responded, when Ray asked if she never had any
time she could call her own. &#8220;Tim thinked I
couldn&#8217;t get tired, I guess. He&#8217;d roust me up fust
of all &#8217;n&#8217; larrup me if he caught me shirkin&#8217;. Once
I had a little posey bed back o&#8217; the pig-pen. I fixed
it after dark an&#8217; mornin&#8217;s when I ketched the
chance. He ketched me thar one mornin&#8217; a-weedin&#8217;
it &#8217;n&#8217; knocked me sprawlin&#8217; an&#8217; then stomped all over
the posies. That night I went out into the woods
&#8217;n&#8217; begged the spites to git him killed somehow.
&#8217;Nother time I forgot to put up the bars, an&#8217; the
cows got into the taters. That night he tied me
to a stump clus to the bars, an&#8217; left me thar all
night. I used to be more skeered o&#8217; my dad &#8217;n
I was o&#8217; Tim, tho&#8217;. He&#8217;d look at me like he hated
me, an&#8217; say, &#8216;Shut up,&#8217; if I said a word, an&#8217; I &#8217;most
believed he&#8217;d kill me, just fer nothin&#8217;. Once he
said he&#8217;d take me out into the woods at night &#8217;n&#8217;
bait a bear trap with me if he heerd I didn&#8217;t mind
Tim. I told Old Tomah that, an&#8217; he said if he did,
he&#8217;d shoot him; but Old Tomah wasn&#8217;t round only
winters. I hated dad so I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; shot him myself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
I guess, if I cud &#8217;a&#8217; got hold o&#8217; a gun when he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
watchin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful to have to feel that way toward your own
father,&#8221; interrupted Ray, &#8220;for he was your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose &#8217;twas,&#8221; admitted Chip, candidly,
&#8220;but I never felt much different. I&#8217;ve seen him
slap mother when she was on her knees a-bawlin&#8217;,
an&#8217; the way he would cuss her was awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had some friendship from this old
Indian,&#8221; queried Ray, who began to realize what
a pitiful life the girl had led; &#8220;he was good to you,
wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was, sartin,&#8221; returned Chip, eagerly; &#8220;he
used to tell me the spites &#8217;ud fix dad &#8217;fore long, so
he&#8217;d never show up agin, &#8217;n&#8217; when I got big &#8217;nuff he&#8217;d
sneak me off some night &#8217;n&#8217; take me to the settlement,
whar I could arn a livin&#8217;. Old Tomah was
the only one who cared a cuss fer me. I used to
bawl when he went away every spring, an&#8217; beg him
to take me &#8217;long &#8217;n&#8217; help him camp &#8217;n&#8217; cook. I&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; done &#8217;most anything fer Old Tomah. I didn&#8217;t
mind havin&#8217; to work all the time fer Tim. I didn&#8217;t
mind wearin&#8217; clothes made out o&#8217; old duds &#8217;n&#8217;
bein&#8217; cussed fer not workin&#8217; hard &#8217;nuff. What I
did mind was not havin&#8217; nobody who cared whether
I lived or died, or said a good word to me. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
I got so lonesome, I used to go out in the woods
nights when &#8217;twas moonlight &#8217;n&#8217; beg the spites to
help me. I used to think mother might be one on
&#8217;em &#8217;n&#8217; she&#8217;d keer fer me. I think she was, an&#8217;
&#8217;twas her as kept me goin&#8217; till I found you folks&#8217;s
camp. I got awful skeered them nights I was
runnin&#8217; away, an&#8217; when &#8217;twas so dark I couldn&#8217;t
see no more, an&#8217; I heerd wildcats yowlin&#8217;, I&#8217;d git
on my knees &#8217;n&#8217; beg mother to keep &#8217;em away. I
think she did, an&#8217; allus shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much more in connection with the wild, harsh
life Chip had led for eight years was now told by
her. Old Tomah&#8217;s superstition and belief in hobgoblins
were enlarged upon. Life at Tim&#8217;s Place,
with all its filth, brutality, and nearly animal existence,
was described in full; for Chip&#8217;s tongue, once
loosened, ran on and on, while Ray, spellbound by
this description, was scarce conscious he was wielding
a paddle. Never before had he heard such a
tale, so unusual and so pathetic. Naturally of
chivalrous and manly nature, it appealed to him as
naught else could. Then the girl herself, with her
big, pleading eyes, her queer belief in those woodsy,
spectral forms she called spites, and her free
and easy confidence in him, and his sympathy also,
surprised Ray. Her speech was coarse and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
crude&#8211;the vernacular of Tim&#8217;s Place. Now and then
a profane word crept in; yet it was absolute truth,
and forceful from its very simplicity.</p>

<p>But another influence, more potent than her
wrongs, was now appealing to Chip&#8211;her sense of
joy at her rescue, and with it a positive faith that
the spites had been the means of her escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know they did it,&#8221; she said time and again,
&#8220;an&#8217; I know mother was one on &#8217;em. I wished I
cud do suthin&#8217; to show &#8217;em how thankful I am &#8217;n&#8217;
how happy I am now.&#8221; And Ray, astonished that
so keen-witted and courageous a girl should have
such a fantastic belief, made no comment.</p>

<p>A more serious subject was under discussion in
the other canoe, meantime, as to the future disposition
of Chip herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel it my duty to take care of her,&#8221; Angie
said, after relating her conversation with Chip and
that morning&#8217;s incident. &#8220;She is a homeless, outcast
waif, needing education and everything else
to Christianize her. We must bring her to the settlement,
but to turn her adrift might mean leaving her
to a life of vice, even if she escapes her brutal father
and this worse half-breed. Then, again, I am not
sure that her parentage will bear inspection. She
has told me something about her earlier life, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
about her mother, who evidently loved her. One
course only seems plain to me,&#8211;to take care of
and educate this unfortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am willing, my dear,&#8221; responded Martin, who,
like all new husbands, was ready to concede anything,
&#8220;only I suggest that you go a little slow.
You can&#8217;t tell yet what this girl will develop into.
She has had the worst possible parentage, without
doubt. Her life at Tim&#8217;s Place, and contact with
lumbermen or worse, has been no benefit. She is
grossly ignorant, and may be ill-tempered, and once
given to understand that you have practically
adopted her, you can&#8217;t&#8211;or won&#8217;t&#8211;have the
heart to turn her off. Now we are to return
to the lake and remain a month, as you know,
and in the meantime, what will you do with this
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was reducing Angie&#8217;s philanthropic impulses
to a focus, as it were, and it set her thinking. Something
more of this discussion followed, and finally
Angie announced her decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must take the girl back with us,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and begin her reformation at the camp. If she
shows any aptitude and willingness to obey, we will
take her to Greenvale. If not, you must arrange
to get her into some institution.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;And suppose the half-breed finds where she is,
what then?&#8221; inquired Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say, Levi?&#8221; he added, turning to
his guide, &#8220;you know this fellow; what will he be
apt to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you know what a panther&#8217;ll do, robbed
of her cub,&#8221; Levi answered, &#8220;an&#8217; how a bull moose
acts in runnin&#8217; time, mebbe. Wal, this Pete is
worse&#8217;n both on &#8217;em biled into one, I callate. If
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter take the gal back, you&#8217;ve got to keep
her shady, or some day you&#8217;ll find her missin&#8217;.
Besides, Pete, ez I told ye, don&#8217;t know the meanin&#8217;
o&#8217; law and is handy with a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Martin did not quite share Levi&#8217;s fears, and
so Angie&#8217;s decision was agreed to. Levi&#8217;s advice
to &#8220;keep shady&#8221; was accepted, however, and all
through that summer&#8217;s somewhat thrilling experiences
it was the rule of conduct.</p>

<p>When noon came, Levi led the way into a lagoon;
in a secluded spot at its head dinner was cooked,
and when the sun was well down and a tributary
stream was reached, he turned into it, and halted not
for the night camp until a full half-mile separated
them from the river.</p>

<p>A certain vague sense of impending danger began
to impress both Martin and his wife, and the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
seemed to hold a one-eyed, malicious villain who
might appear at any moment. A danger which we
know actually exists, we can avoid or meet squarely;
but one merely imaginary becomes irksome and
really more annoying.</p>

<p>No hint of this was dropped by the three older
ones, and when the tents were pitched, long before
twilight, and Martin and Ray had captured a goodly
string of trout and the camp-fire was alight, this
wildwood life seemed absolutely perfect, to the
young folks at least.</p>

<p>Chip also showed one of the best features of her
training. She wanted to help everybody and do
everything, and Levi, who always did the cooking,
was importuned to let her help. Strong as a young
Amazon, she fetched and carried like a man, and
the one thing that gladdened her most was permission
to work.</p>

<p>When supper was over came the lounging beside
the cheerful fire, and as the shadows thickened,
forth came Ray&#8217;s banjo once more, and with it the
light of admiration in Chip&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>All that day he had been her charming companion;
his open, manly face, his bright brown
eyes, had been ever before her. His well-bred
ways, so unlike all the men at Tim&#8217;s Place, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
impressed her as those of a youth of eighteen will
a maid of sixteen; and now, with his voice appealing
to the best in her, he seemed like Pan of old,
once more wooing a nymph with his pipes.</p>

<p>No knowledge of this was hers, no consciousness
of why she was happy came to her. She knew
what spites were; but the god Pan and Apollo with
his harp were unknown forms.</p>

<p>Neither did she realize that born in her soul that
day, on the broad shining river, was a magic impulse
woven out of heart throbs, and destined to mete out
to her more sorrow than all else in her life combined.</p>

<p>She had entered the wondrous vale of love whose
paths are flower-strewn, whose shores are rippled
with laughter, and whose borders, alas! are ever
hid in the midst of tears.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The wilderness allus seems full o&#8217; spectres &#8217;n&#8217; creepin&#8217;
crawlin&#8217; panthers. Sometimes I think it&#8217;s God, an&#8217; then
agin, the devil.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Tim&#8217;s Place</span>, this refuge in the wilderness, cleared
and colonized by Tim Connor, was neither better
nor worse than such pioneer openings in Nature&#8217;s
domain are apt to be. Tim, a hardy Irishman of
sod-hovel and potato-diet ancestors, had been
blacksmith for a lumber camp on this broad river
and at its junction with a tributary called the Fox
Hole years before Chip was born.</p>

<p>When all the adjacent lumber was cut and sent
down this river, the camp was abandoned, and then
Tim saw his opening. With his precious winter&#8217;s
wages he purchased a large tract of this now worthless
land, induced a robust Bridget, his brother
Mike, and his consort to join fortunes with him,
brought in cows, horses, pigs, and poultry, and
began farming with the lumber camp as domicile.</p>

<p>Another log cabin was soon added, the first crop
of potatoes sold readily to other lumbermen farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
in the wilderness, the pigs in a sty adjacent to his
own throve, the poultry multiplied, children came,
and the red-shirted men coming into the wilderness
or going out found Tim&#8217;s Place convenient.</p>

<p>With this added business came an enlargement
in Tim&#8217;s ideas, the outcome of which was a framed
house containing a kitchen and dining room and
half a dozen others of closet-like proportions, furnished
with box-on-legs beds. It was not a pretentious
hostelry. Paint, shutters, and carpets were
absent, benches served for chairs, the only mirror in
it was eight by twelve inches, and used in common
by Bridget and Mary. The toilet conveniences
consisted of a wash-basin in the kitchen sink and
a &#8220;last year&#8217;s&#8221; towel, used semi-occasionally. A
long table bare of cloth and set with tinware served
in the dining room, warmed in winter by a round
sheet-iron stove; above it usually hung an array
of socks and mittens, and a capacious cook stove
half filled the kitchen. It was the crudest possible
backwoods abode, and yet compared to the log
cabin first occupied by Tim, it was a palace, and he
was proud of it.</p>

<p>In autumn swarms of lumbermen halted there,
content to sleep on the floor if need be. In spring
they came again, log-driving down stream; later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
a few sportsmen occasionally tried it, and all fared
alike.</p>

<p>There was no sentiment about Tim. If the
citified fishermen objected to what they found,
&#8220;Be gob, you kin kape away,&#8221; he readily told them.
A quarter for each meal, or a night&#8217;s lodging, was
the price, whether a bed or the floor was provided,
and from early spring until frost came, all the occupants
went barefoot.</p>

<p>When snow had made the sixty miles of log road
to the nearest settlement passable, Tim invariably
journeyed hither with horse and bob-sled for clothing
and supplies.</p>

<p>No knowledge or news from the world reached
here, unless brought by chance visitors. Sundays
were an unknown factor, the work of clearing land
and potato-raising became a continuous performance
from spring until autumn; and the change
of seasons, the rise and fall of the river, were the
only measure of time.</p>

<p>An addition to Tim&#8217;s Place, other than babies
and pigs, came one fall in an old Indian who, by
ample presents of game, soon won Tim&#8217;s good-will
and help in the erection of a log wigwam; but this
relic of a vanishing race&#8211;reckoned by Tim as partially
insane&#8211;remained there only winters, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
when spring returned, disappeared into the wilderness.</p>

<p>There were also two other occasional visitors both
meriting description. First, a beetle-browed, keen-eyed,
red-haired man garbed as a hunter, whose
speech disclosed something of the Scotch dialect,
and who, presenting Tim with a deer and two
bottles of whiskey as a peace-offering on his first
arrival, soon obtained a welcome. He told a plausible
tale of having been pursued for years by enemies
seeking his life; how he had been robbed and
driven away from the settlements; and how two of
these enemies had even followed him into the woods.
He had been shot at by them, had killed one in
self-defence, a price had been set upon his capture,
dead or alive, and, all in all, he was a sorely abused
man.</p>

<p>How much of this lurid and fantastic tale Tim
believed, is not pertinent to this narrative. The
stranger, calling himself McGuire, was evidently a
good fellow, since he brought good whiskey, and
Tim made him welcome.</p>

<p>The facts as to McGuire, however, were somewhat
at variance with his assertions. He had originally
been a dive-keeper in a focal city for the lumbering
interests of this wilderness, had entertained swarms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
of log-drivers just paid off and anxious to spend
money, and when the law interfered, he retreated
to a smaller town.</p>

<p>In the interval, strange to say, his moral nature&#8211;or rather immoral&#8211;suffered a brief relapse,
during which he persuaded an excellent if confiding
young woman to share his name and infamy.</p>

<p>His second business venture came to grief, however,
and his wife deserted him and met with a fatal
accident a few years after. In the meantime he
had kept busy, exercising his peculiar talents and
tastes in an individual manner, and evading officers,
and his ways of money-getting were peculiar and
diverse.</p>

<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act had just become operative,
and the admission of Celestials into the land
of the free, and of good wages, became a valuable
matter. McGuire conceived the brilliant, if grewsome,
idea of passing &#8220;Chinks&#8221; over the border
line concealed in coffins. It worked admirably, and
with accomplices on both sides to obtain certificates
and permits, and take charge of the &#8220;corpses,&#8221;
a few dozen almond-eyed immigrants at two hundred
dollars each obtained admission.</p>

<p>In time, this budding industry met an official
quietus, and McGuire, with several warrants out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
against him, took to the woods. He still continued
business, however, in various ways. He smuggled
liquor over the border by canoe loads, hiding it
at convenient points, to exchange for log-drivers&#8217;
wages. He killed game out of season, and dynamited
trout and salmon on spawning beds for the
same purpose; and, handy with cards, did not
disdain their use in lumbering camps.</p>

<p>In all and through all his various ways of money-getting,
one purpose had governed him&#8211;that of
money-saving. Trusting no one, as he had reason
to feel no one trusted him, he continually emulated
the squirrels and hid his savings in the woods. A
trapper and hunter by instinct, as well as thief,
dive-keeper, smuggler, poacher, and gambler, he
had in his wanderings discovered a cave in a slate
ledge upon the shores of a small lake far into the
wilderness. It was while trapping here that he
found this by the aid of a fox which, while dragging
a trap, became caught and held in a crevasse while
attempting to enter it.</p>

<p>The fox thus secured, McGuire made further
investigation, and by removing a loose slab of slate,
he was enabled to enter a roomy cavern, or rather
two small ones partially separated by slate walls.
A little light entered the larger one, through a seam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
crossing it lengthwise. They were free from moisture
at this time&#8211;early autumn&#8211;and so secluded
was the spot that McGuire decided at once to use
this place as a hiding-spot for his money. The
entrance could be kept concealed, its location served
his purpose, and, fox-like himself, he decided to
occupy what he would never have found without
the aid of a fox, believing no one else would find it.
It could also be used as a domicile for himself as
well. A fireplace of slate could be built in it, an
escape for smoke might be formed through the crack,
if enlarged, and so this cave&#8217;s possibilities increased.</p>

<p>There were still several other advantages. This
lake was surrounded by precipitous mountains; no
lumbermen, even, were likely to operate there; the
stream flowing out of it soon crossed the border line,
finding escape into the St. Lawrence valley at a point
some twenty miles distant; a short carry enabled
him to reach the Fox Hole which flowed by Tim&#8217;s
Place, and so this served as an excellent whip road
in case of pursuit.</p>

<p>His transient asylum at Tim&#8217;s Place also served
as a vantage point in another way.</p>

<p>Here all who entered this portion of the wilderness
invariably halted,&#8211;officers and wardens as well,&#8211;and
as by this time McGuire had become an outlaw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
murderer, with a reward offered for his capture,
this outpost was of double advantage.</p>

<p>Caution was a strong point in his make-up, yet
he was daring as well. He still visited the settlements
occasionally, to sell furs and obtain ammunition
and whiskey; and when he, as ill luck would have
it, happened there at the time his child was left
motherless, some malign impulse led him to take
her to Tim&#8217;s Place and leave her in servitude there.</p>

<p>There was also another chance caller at this outpost&#8211;a half-breed trapper and hunter named Bolduc,
who had established himself in a lone cabin on the
Fox Hole, some ten miles up from Tim&#8217;s Place. He
was a repulsive minor edition of McGuire. A
wildcat, with laudable intentions, had essayed
putting an end to his career, and succeeded to the
extent of one eye and some blood. He had been
the accomplice and partner of McGuire in many
a whiskey-smuggling trip. He also dealt in this
pernicious, but valuable, fluid, was a poacher ever
ready to pot-hunt for a lumbering camp in winter,
or find a moose yard on snow-shoes, after slaughtering
the helpless inmates of which, he would sell them
to the busy wood-choppers.</p>

<p>He, too, could be classed as brigand of the wilderness,
and while no warrants or charges against him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
were rife, he felt it wise to avoid meeting minions
of the law. Tim&#8217;s Place was a convenient point
to obtain information as to location of new lumber
camps or possible visits of officers. An occasional
bottle of whiskey secured Tim&#8217;s favor. The evenings
and meals there impressed Pete with the advantages
of owning a woman&#8217;s services, and as Chip
matured in domestic and other possibilities, a desire
to possess her began to increase his visits.</p>

<p>His wooing met no response, however, and when
persisted in always awoke on her part the same
instinct once displayed toward him by a wildcat.</p>

<p>Then recourse to her father&#8217;s greed for money
was taken, with results as described.</p>

<p>The only thing that saved poor Chip from pursuit
and capture, however, was his wholesome fear
of her finger-nails, and the belief that it was best
to let her father earn the balance of her price and
fetch her, as agreed. Acting upon this theory,
Pete had departed from Tim&#8217;s Place at dawn, to
await her arrival at his cabin, quite oblivious of the
fact that his bird had flown.</p>

<p>All that long day he waited in great expectancy.
Toward evening he returned to Tim&#8217;s Place to learn
that Chip had not been seen since the previous
night; that her father had also vanished without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
comment. That he was a party to this trick and
deception, and, after securing his three hundred
dollars, had taken her away, was Pete&#8217;s conclusion,
and he vowed a murderous revenge. He returned
to his cabin, little realizing that twenty miles away
poor Chip, faint with hunger and the terror of a
vast wilderness, was fighting her way through bush,
bramble, and swamp in a mad attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Neither did Tim, while regretting the loss of his
slave, know or care that one of his occasional visitors
was now a mortal enemy of the other, and that
a tragedy, dark and grewsome, would be its outcome.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The size o&#8217; a toad is allus reg&#8217;lated by the size o&#8217; the
puddle.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>A week</span> was spent by Martin and his party at the
settlement, during which he acquired the title to
township forty-four, range ten, which included the
little lake near the hermit&#8217;s hut, and made a foursquare-mile
tract about it.</p>

<p>Chip, thanks to Angie, secured a simple outfit of
apparel and&#8211;surprising fact&#8211;evinced excellent
taste in its selection, thereby proving that eight years
of isolation and a gunny-sack and red-shirt garb
had not obliterated the deepest instinct of woman.</p>

<p>To Levi, Martin&#8217;s woodwise helper, was left the
selection of fittings for the new camp. A couple of
husky Canucks were engaged to bring them in in
a bateau, and then the party started on its return.</p>

<p>Only one incident of importance occurred during
the wait at this village known as Grindstone. Angie
and Chip had just left the only store there, in front
of which a group of log-drivers had congregated,
when Angie, glancing back, saw that one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
group was following them. She quickened her
pace, and so did he, until just as they turned into a
side street, he passed them, halted, and turned about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m damned if &#8217;tain&#8217;t Chip, an&#8217; dressed
like a leddy,&#8221; he exclaimed, as they drew near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Chip,&#8221; he added, as they passed, &#8220;when
did you strike luck?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chip made no response and he muttered again,
&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m damned, jest like a leddy!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was annoying, especially to Angie, and neither
of the two realized how soon this blunt log-driver&#8217;s
discovery would reach Tim&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>And now, leaving the bateau to follow, the party
started once more on their journey into the wilderness.
No sight or sign of pursuit from the half-breed
had been thus far observed. A few idle
lumbermen in the village&#8211;the only visible connection
between the vast forest and a busy world&#8211;were little thought of, as their canoes crept
slowly up the narrowing river and gave no hint of
interference from this low brute to any one except
Levi.</p>

<p>He, however, seldom speaking, but ever acting,
kept watch and ward continually. At every bend
of the stream his eyes were alert to catch the first
sight of a down-coming canoe in time to conceal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
Chip, as he decided must be done. When night
camps were made, a site at the head of the lagoon
or up some tributary stream was selected, and while
not even hinting his reason for this, he felt it wise.
As they drew near to Tim&#8217;s Place, it began to occur
to Martin that Chip&#8217;s presence had best be concealed
until that point was passed. He also desired to
learn the situation there. He had always halted
at this clearing in all his up-river journeys, so far,
usually to buy pork and potatoes, and he now intended
to do so again. He also felt it imperative
to conceal Chip in Ray&#8217;s canoe, before they reached
Tim&#8217;s Place, and let Ray paddle slowly on while
the halt was made. But Levi dissented.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t best,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to let Tim know there&#8217;s
two canoes of us and one not stoppin&#8217;. It&#8217;ll make
him s&#8217;picious o&#8217; suthin, &#8217;n&#8217; what he &#8217;spects, Pete&#8217;ll
find out. I callate we&#8217;d best pass thar in the night,
leave the wimmen above, &#8217;n&#8217; you &#8217;n&#8217; I go back &#8217;n&#8217; git
what we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about the Canucks following us with
the bateau?&#8221; returned Martin. &#8220;They&#8217;ll tell who
is with us, won&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t see us start,&#8221; answered Levi, &#8220;&#8217;n&#8217;
can&#8217;t swear wimmen came. We&#8217;ll say we&#8217;re alone, &#8217;n&#8217;
bein&#8217; so&#8217;ll make it plausible, &#8217;n&#8217; you might say we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
goin&#8217; to build a camp &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;nother season fetch our
wimmen in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about our men, on the return trip, after
finding we have women at the camp?&#8221; rejoined
Martin. &#8220;They will be sure to tell all they know
on the way back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to keep the wimmen shady, an&#8217; fool
&#8217;em,&#8221; answered Levi. And so his plan was adopted.</p>

<p>It was in the early hours of morning when the
two canoes crept noiselessly past Tim&#8217;s Place. The
stars barely outlined the river&#8217;s course, the frame
dwelling, log cabin, and stump-dotted slope back
of them. All the untidiness existent about this
dwelling was hid in darkness, and only the faint
sounds and odors betrayed these conditions. But
every eye and ear in the two canoes was alert, paddles
were dipped without sound, and Chip&#8217;s heart
was beating so loudly that it seemed to her Tim and
all his family must be awakened. Her recent escape
from this spot and all the reasons forcing it, the
fear that both her father and the half-breed might
even now be there, added dread; and not until a
bend hid even the shadowy view of this plague spot
did she breathe easier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was nigh skeered to death,&#8221; she whispered
to Ray when safety seemed assured, &#8220;an&#8217; if ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
Pete finds I&#8217;m up whar the folks is goin&#8217;, I&#8217;m a
goner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll take care of you,&#8221; returned that boy,
with the boundless confidence of youth; &#8220;my uncle
can shoot as well as any one, and then Old Cy is up
at the camp, and he&#8217;s a wonder with a rifle. Why,
I&#8217;ve seen him hit a crow a half-mile off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Smoke was ascending from the chimney, and the
rising sun was just visible when Martin and Levi
returned to Tim&#8217;s. Mike was out in an enclosure,
milking; Tim was back of the house, preparing the
pigs&#8217; breakfast. The pigs were squealing, and a
group of unwashed children were watching operations,
when Martin appeared. A pleasant &#8220;Good
morning&#8221; from him and a gruff one from Tim was
the introduction, and then that stolid pioneer started
for the sty. Not even the unusual event of a caller
could hinder him from the one duty he most enjoyed,&#8211;the care of his beloved swine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some nice thrifty pigs,&#8221; began Martin,
when the pen was reached, desiring to placate Tim.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are thot,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;My guide and I are on our way into the woods,
to build a camp,&#8221; continued Martin, anxious to
have his errand over with, &#8220;and we halted to buy a
few potatoes of you and some pork. I have a couple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
of men following with a bateau,&#8221; he continued,
after pausing for a reply which did not come; &#8220;they
will be along in a day or two with most of our supplies;
but I felt sure I could get some extra good
pork of you and some choice potatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You kin thot same,&#8221; replied Tim, his demeanor
obviously softening under this flattery, and so business
relations were established.</p>

<p>Martin had intended asking some cautious question
regarding Chip or her father; but Tim&#8217;s surly
face, his unresponsive manner, and a mistrust of
its wisdom prevented. He was blunt of speech,
almost to the verge of insolence, and the arrival of
Martin with all his polite words evoked not a vestige
of welcome; and yet back of those keen gray
eyes of his a deal of cunning might lurk, thought
Martin.</p>

<p>Two slovenly women peered out of back door and
window while the interview was in progress. Mike
came and looked on in silence; two of the oldest
children were down by the canoe where Levi waited;
the rest, open-eyed and astonished, seemed likely
to be trodden on by some one each moment. When
the stores were secured and paid for, and Martin
had pushed off with Levi, he realized something of
the life Chip must have led there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>He had intended not only to obtain potatoes,
but some information of value. He obtained the
goods, paying a thrifty price, also a good bit of
cold shoulder, and that was all.</p>

<p>But Levi, shrewd woodsman that he was, fared
better.</p>

<p>&#8220;I larned Chip&#8217;s gone off with old McGuire,&#8221;
he asserted with a quiet smile when they were well
away, &#8220;an&#8217; that Pete&#8217;s swearin&#8217; murder agin him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221; responded Martin, in astonishment.
&#8220;I felt that silence was golden with that
surly chap, and didn&#8217;t ask a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; rejoined Levi. &#8220;I wanted to tell you
not to, and I&#8217;ve larned all we want. Children
are easy to pump, an&#8217; I did it &#8217;thout wakin&#8217; a hint
o&#8217; &#8217;spicion. Tim&#8217;s folks all believe Chip&#8217;s gone
with her dad. Pete thinks so, an&#8217; is watchin&#8217;
for him with a gun, I &#8217;spect, an&#8217; if so, the sooner
they meet, the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was gratifying news to Martin, and when the
other canoe was reached, the two again pushed on,
with Martin, at least, feeling that the ways of Fate
might prove acceptable.</p>

<p>Three days more were consumed in reaching
the lake now owned by him, for the river was low,
carries had to be made around two rapids, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
when at last the sequestered, forest-bordered sheet
of water was being crossed, Martin wished some
titanic hand might raise an impassable barrier
about his possessions.</p>

<p>Old Cy&#8217;s joy at their return was almost hilarious.
To a man long past the spasmodic exuberance
of youth, loving nature and the wild as few do,
the six months here with the misanthropic old
hermit, then a month of more cheerful companionship,
followed by the departure of Martin and Angie,
made this forest home-coming doubly welcome.</p>

<p>But Chip&#8217;s appearance, and the somewhat thrilling
episode of her escape from Tim&#8217;s Place and
her rescue, astonished him. Like all old men
who are childless, a young girl and her troubles
touched a responsive chord in his heart, and on
the instant Chip&#8217;s unfortunate condition found
sympathy. Her bluntly told story, with all its
details, held him spellbound. He laughed over
her description of spites, and when she seemed
hurt at this seeming levity, he assured her that
spites were a reality in the woods&#8211;he had seen
hundreds of them. It was not long ere he had
won her confidence and good-will, as he had Ray&#8217;s,
and then he took Martin aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;That gal&#8217;s chaser&#8217;s bin here &#8217;bout a week ago,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
he said, &#8220;an&#8217; the worst-lookin&#8217; cuss I ever seen.
I know from his description &#8217;twas him. He kept
quizzin&#8217; me ez to how long we&#8217;d been here, if I knew
McGuire, or had seen him lately, until I got sorter
riled &#8217;n&#8217; began to string him. I told him finally
that I&#8217;d been foolin&#8217; all &#8217;long; that McGuire was a
friend o&#8217; mine; that he&#8217;d been here a day or two
afore, borrowed some money &#8217;n&#8217; lit out fer Canada,
knowin&#8217; there was a bad man arter him. Then
this one-eyed gazoo got mad, real mad, &#8217;n&#8217; said
things, an&#8217; then he cleared out.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Martin explained the situation, as he
now did, Old Cy chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t often one shoots in the dark &#8217;n&#8217; makes
a bull&#8217;s eye,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you and I had better keep mum about
this half-breed&#8217;s call,&#8221; Martin added quietly,
&#8220;and if Angie mentions it, you needn&#8217;t say that
you know who he was. It will only make my
wife and the girl nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two tents were now pitched at the head of
a cove, some rods away from the hermit&#8217;s hut,
and well out of sight from the landing, and to
these both Angie and Chip were assured they
must flee as soon as the expected bateau entered
the lake, and remain secluded until it had departed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>In a way, it was a ticklish situation. All knowledge
that this waif was with Martin&#8217;s party must
be kept from Tim&#8217;s Place and this half-breed,
or she wouldn&#8217;t be safe an hour; and until the
Canucks had come and gone, she must be kept
hidden. Another and quite a serious annoyance
to Martin was the fact that he had counted on
these two men as helpers in cutting and hauling
logs for this new camp. Only man-power was
available, and to move logs a foot in diameter and
twenty feet long, in midsummer, was no easy
task; but Levi, more experienced in camp-building,
made light of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cut the logs we need, clus to the lake,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;float &#8217;em &#8217;round, &#8217;n&#8217; roll &#8217;em up on skids.
It&#8217;s easy &#8217;nough, &#8217;n&#8217; we don&#8217;t need them Canuckers
round a minit.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was four days of keen suspense to Chip before
they appeared. Neither she nor Angie left the
closed tent while they remained over night, or
until they had been gone many hours, and then
every one felt easier.</p>

<p>The ringing sound of axes now began to echo over
the rippled lake, logs were towed across with canoes,
a cellar under the new cabin site was excavated, and
home-building in the wilderness went merrily on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>While the men worked, Angie and Chip were
not idle. Not only did they have meals to prepare
over a rude outdoor fireplace, but they gathered
grass and moss for beds, wove a hammock and
rustic chair seats out of sedge grass, and countless
other useful aids.</p>

<p>Chip was especially helpful and more grateful
than a dog for any and all consideration. Not
a step that she could take or a bit of work that she
could do was left to Angie; her interest and do-all-she-could
desire never flagged, and from early
morn until the supper dishes were washed and
wiped, Chip was busy.</p>

<p>But Martin, and especially Levi, had other
causes for worry than those which camp-building
entailed. The fact that this &#8220;Pernicious
Pete,&#8221; as Angie had once called him, would
soon learn of their presence here, and hating
all law-abiding people, as such forest brigands
always do, would naturally seek to injure them,
was one cause. Then, there were so many ways
by which he could do harm. A fire started at
one corner of the hut at midnight, the same Indian-like
malice applied to their two tents, the stealing
of their canoes or the gashing of them with
a hunting-knife, and countless other methods of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
venting spite, presented themselves. In a way,
they were helpless against such a night-prowling
enemy. Over one hundred miles separated them
from civilization and all assistance; an impassable
wilderness lay between. The stream and
their canoes were the only means of egress. These
valuable craft were left out of sight and sound
each night, on the lake shore, and so their vulnerability
on all sides was manifest.</p>

<p>Then, Chip&#8217;s presence was an added danger.
If once this brute found that she was here, there
was no limit to what he would do to secure her
and take revenge. They had smuggled her past
Tim&#8217;s Place, but concealment here was impossible;
if ever this half-breed returned, she would
be discovered, and then what?</p>

<p>And so by day, while Martin and Levi were
busy with hut-building, or beside the evening
camp-fire when Ray picked his banjo and Chip
watched him with admiring glances, these two
guardians had eyes and ears ever alert for this
expected enemy.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;It allus makes me coltish to see two young folks a-weavin&#8217;
the thread o&#8217; affection.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>There</span> were three people at Birch Camp,&#8211;as
Angie had christened it,&#8211;namely, herself, Ray,
and Chip, who did not share Martin&#8217;s suspicion
of danger. A firm belief that a woman&#8217;s aid in
such a complication was of no value, coupled with
a desire to save her anxiety, had kept his lips closed
as to the situation.</p>

<p>Life here at all hours soon settled itself into a
certain daily routine of work, amusement, and,
on Chip&#8217;s part, of study. True to her philanthropic
sense of duty toward this waif, Angie had
at once set about her much-needed education.
A reading and spelling book suitable for a child
of eight had been secured at the settlement, and
now &#8220;lessons&#8221; occupied a few hours of each day.</p>

<p>It was only a beginning, of course, and yet with
constant reminders as to pronunciation, this was
all that Angie could do. The idioms of Tim&#8217;s
Place, with all its profanity, still adhered to Chip&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
speech. This latter, especially, would now and
then crop out in spite of all admonitions; and so
Angie found that her pupil made slow progress.</p>

<p>There was also another reason for this. Chip
was afraid of her, and oft reproved for her lapses
in speech, soon ceased all unnecessary talk when
with Angie.</p>

<p>But with Ray it was different. He was near
her own age, the companionship of youth was
theirs, and with him Chip&#8217;s speech was ready
enough. This, of course, answered all the purposes
of benefit by assimilation, and so Angie was
well satisfied that they should be together. Beyond
that she had no thought that love might
accrue from this association.</p>

<p>Chip, while fair of face and form, and at a sentimental
age, was so crude of speech, so grossly
ignorant, and so allied to the ways and manners
of Tim&#8217;s Place, that, according to Angie&#8217;s reasoning,
Ray&#8217;s feelings were safe enough. He was
well bred and refined, a happy, natural boy now
verging upon manhood. In Greenvale he had
never shown much interest in girls&#8217; society, and
while he now showed a playmate enjoyment of
Chip&#8217;s company, that was all that was likely to
happen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>But the winged god wots not of speech or manners.
A youth of eighteen and a maid of sixteen
are the same the world over, and so out of sight
of Angie, and unsuspected by her, the by-play of
heart-interest went on.</p>

<p>And what a glorious golden summer opportunity
these two had!</p>

<p>Back of the camp and tending northwest to
southeast was a low ridge of outcropping slate,
bare in spots&#8211;a hog-back, in wilderness phrase.
Beyond this lay a mile-long &#8220;blow-down,&#8221; where
a tornado had levelled the tall timber. A fire,
sweeping this when dry, left a criss-cross confusion
of charred logs, blueberry bushes had followed
fast, and now those luscious berries were
ripening in limitless profusion. Every fair day
Ray and Chip came here to pick, to eat, to hear
the birds sing, to gather flowers and be happy.</p>

<p>They watched the rippled lake with now and
then a deer upon its shores, from this ridge; they
climbed up or down it, hand in hand; they
fished in the lake or canoed about it, time and
again; and many a summer evening, when the
moon served, Chip handled the paddle, while Ray
picked his banjo and sang his darky songs all
around this placid sheet of water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>And what a wondrous charm this combination
of moonlight on the lake and love songs softened
and made tender by the still water held for Chip!
As those melodies had done on that first evening
beside the camp-fire, so now they filled her soul
with a strange, new-born, and wonderful sense of
joy and gladness.</p>

<p>The black forest enclosing them now was sombre
and silent. Spites still lurked in its depths and
doubtless were watching; but a protector was
near, his arm was strong; back at the landing
were kind friends, and the undulating path of
silvered light, the round, smiling orb above, the
twinkling stars, and this matchless music became
a new wonder-world to her.</p>

<p>Her eyes glistened and grew tender with pathos.
She had no more idea than a child why she was
happy. Each day sped by on wings of wind,
each hour, with her one best companion, the most
joyful, and so, day by day, poor Chip learned the
sad lesson of loving.</p>

<p>But never a word or hint of this fell from her
lips. Ray was so far above her and such a young
hero, that she, a homeless outcast, tainted by the
filth and service of Tim&#8217;s Place, could only look
to him as she did to the moon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>They laughed and exchanged histories. Ofttimes
he reproved her speech. They fished, picked
berries, and worked together like two big children,
and only her wistful eyes told the other why they
were wistful.</p>

<p>Martin, busy at camp-building and watching
ever for an enemy&#8217;s coming, saw it not. Angie
was as obtuse; the old hermit, misanthropic and
verging into dotage, was certainly oblivious, and
so no ripples of interest disturbed these workers.</p>

<p>Such conditions were as sunshine to flowers in
aiding the two young lovers, so this forest idyl
matured rapidly. Chip, perhaps more imaginative
than Ray, since most of her education had
been the weird superstition of Old Tomah, felt
most of its emotional force, though unconscious
of the reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno why I feel so upset all the time lately,&#8221;
she said one afternoon to Ray as, returning from
the berry field, they halted on top of the ridge to
scan the lake below. &#8220;Some o&#8217; the time I feel
so happy I want to sing, &#8217;n&#8217; then I feel jes&#8217; t&#8217;other
way, &#8217;n&#8217; like cryin&#8217;. When the good spell is on,
everything looks so purty, &#8217;n&#8217; when I come on to
a bunch o&#8217; posies, then I feel I must go right down
on my knees &#8217;n&#8217; kiss &#8217;em. When I was at Tim&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
Place, I never thought about anything &#8217;cept to
get my work done &#8217;n&#8217; keep from gettin&#8217; cussed &#8217;n&#8217;
licked. I was scart, too, most o&#8217; the time, &#8217;n&#8217; kept
feelin&#8217; suthin awful was goin&#8217; to happen to me.
Now that&#8217;s &#8217;most gone, but I feel a heartache in
place on&#8217;t. I allus hev a spell o&#8217; feelin&#8217; so every
mornin&#8217; when I wake up &#8217;n&#8217; hear the birds singin&#8217;.
They &#8217;fect me so that I&#8217;m near cryin&#8217; &#8217;fore I git up.
You &#8217;n&#8217; Mis&#8217; Frisbie &#8217;n&#8217; everybody&#8217;s been so good
to me, I guess it&#8217;s made me silly. Then thar&#8217;s
&#8217;nother thing worries me, an&#8217; that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to the
settlement whar you folks is from. I feel I kin
sorter earn my keepin&#8217; here, but I s&#8217;pose I can&#8217;t
thar, &#8217;n&#8217; that bothers me. If only you &#8217;n&#8217; all the
rest was goin&#8217; to stay here all the time &#8217;n&#8217; I could
work some, same as I do now, an&#8217; be with you odd
spells &#8217;n&#8217; evenin&#8217;s, I&#8217;d be so happy. It &#8217;ud be
jest like the spot Old Tomah said we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
when we die. He used to tell how &#8217;twas summer
thar all the time, with game plenty, berries ripe,
flowers growin&#8217;, too, all the year &#8217;round, &#8217;n&#8217; birds
singin&#8217;. He believed thar was two places somewhar:
one for white folks and one fer Injuns; that
when we died we turned into spites, stayed &#8217;round
till we got revenge for everything bad done us, or
got a chance to pay up what good we owed for.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where we go to when we quit
this world, and neither does anybody else, I believe,&#8221;
Ray answered philosophically, and scarce
understanding Chip&#8217;s mood. &#8220;I believe, as Old
Cy does, that the time to be happy is when we are
young and can be; that when we are ready to leave
this world is time enough for another one. As
to your worrying about your going to Greenvale,&#8221;
he added confidently, and encircling Chip&#8217;s waist
with one arm, &#8220;why, you&#8217;ve got me to look out
for you, and then Angie won&#8217;t begrudge you your
keep, so don&#8217;t think about that.&#8221; And then this
young optimist, quite content with what the gods
had provided in this maid of sweet lip and appealing
eye, assured her she had everything to make
her happy, including himself for companion; that
all her moody spells were merely memories of Tim&#8217;s
Place, best forgotten, and much more of equally
tender and silly import.</p>

<p>Not for one instant did he realize the growing
independence and self-reliance of this wilderness
waif, or how the first feeling that she was a burden
upon these kind people would chafe and vex her
defiant nature, until she would scorn even love,
to escape it.</p>

<p>Just now the tender impulse of first love was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
all Ray felt or considered. This girl of sweet
sixteen and utter confidence in him was so enthralling
in spite of her crude speech and lack of education,
her kisses were so much his to take whenever
chance offered, and himself such a young hero in
her sight, that he thought of naught else.</p>

<p>In this, or at least so far as his reasoning went,
they were like two grown-up children entering a
new world&#8211;the enchanted garden of love. Or
like two souls merged into one in impulse, yet
in no wise conscious why or for what all-wise
purpose.</p>

<p>For them alone the sun shone, birds sang, leaves
rustled, flowers bloomed, and the blue lake rippled.
For them alone was all this charming chance
given, with all that made it entrancing. For
them alone was life, love, and lips that met in
ecstasy.</p>

<p>Oh, wondrous beatitude! Oh, heaven-born
joy! Oh, divine illusion that builds the world
anew, and building thus, believes its secret safe!</p>

<p>But Old Cy, wise old observer of all things
human, from the natural attraction of two children
to the philosophy of content, saw and understood.</p>

<p>Not for worlds would he hint this to Angie or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Martin. Full well he knew how soon this &#8220;weavin&#8217;
o&#8217; the threads o&#8217; affection,&#8221; would be frowned
upon by them; but he loved children as few men
do.</p>

<p>This summer-day budding of romance would
end in a few weeks, these two were happy now&#8211;let
them remain so, and perhaps in Chip&#8217;s case it
might prove the one best incentive to her own
improvement.</p>

<p>And now as he watched them day by day, came
another feeling. Homeless all his life so far, and
for many years a wanderer, these two had awakened
the home-building impulse in his. He could
not have a home himself, he could only help them
to one in the future, and to that end and purpose
he now bent his thought.</p>

<p>The weeks there with Ray had opened Old
Cy&#8217;s heart to him. Even sooner, and with greater
force, had Chip&#8217;s helpless condition made the
same appeal, and as he watched her wistful eyes
and willing ways, in spite of her speech and in
spite of her origin, he saw in her the making of a
good wife and mother. Her heritage, as he now
guessed, was of the worst, her education was yet
to be obtained; but for all that, a girl&#8211;no, a
child&#8211;of sixteen who would dare sixty miles of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
wilderness alone to save herself from a shameful
fate, was of the metal and fibre to win, and more
than that, deserved the best that life afforded.</p>

<p>How he could at present aid her, he saw not.
A few years of help and time to study must be
given her, and as Old Cy realized how much must
be done for her and how uncertain it was whether
Angie would find time, or be willing to do it, then
and there he determined to share that duty with
her.</p>

<p>It was midsummer when Martin and his party
returned to the lake with Chip. In two weeks
the new log cabin&#8211;a large one, divided into three
compartments&#8211;was erected and ready for occupation,
and so convenient and picturesque a wildwood
dwelling was it that a brief description may
be tolerated.</p>

<p>All log cabins are much alike&#8211;a square enclosure
of unhewn logs thatched with saplings and
chinked with mud and moss. A low door of
boards or split poles is the usual entrance, with
one small window for light; its floor may be of
small split logs or mother earth, and at best it is
a cramped, cheerless hovel.</p>

<p>But Martin&#8217;s was a more pretentious creation.
Its location, well out on the birch-clad point, back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
of which stood the hermit&#8217;s hut, commanded a
view of the lake. A group of tall-stemmed spruce,
amid which it stood, gave shade, yet allowed observation.
It was of oblong shape, with a wide piazza
of white birch poles and roof of same; two four-pane
windows to each room gave ample light;
a small Franklin stove had been brought for the
sitting room, and a cook stove occupied the &#8220;lean-to&#8221;
cook room back of the main cabin. Beds,
chairs, and benches were fashioned from the plentiful
white birch stems, and floor and doors were
of planed boards.</p>

<p>It was but a crude structure, compared to even
the humblest of civilized dwellings; and yet with
all its fittings conveyed into this wilderness in one
bateau, and with only axes, a saw, and hammer
for tools, as was the case, it was a marvel.</p>

<p>Working as all the men had done from dawn
until dark to complete this cabin, no recreation
had been taken by any one except Ray and Chip;
and now Martin, a keen sportsman, felt that his
turn had come. The trout were rising night and
morn all over the lake, partridges so tame that
they would scarce fly were as plenty as sparrows,
a half-dozen deer could be seen any time along
the lake shore&#8211;in fact, one had already furnished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
them venison&#8211;and so Martin now anticipated
some relaxation and sport.</p>

<p>But Fate willed otherwise.</p>

<p>One of Old Cy&#8217;s first and most far-sighted bits
of work, after being left with the hermit the previous
autumn, had been the erection of an ice-house
out of large saplings. It stood at the foot of a
high bank on the north of the knoll and close to
the lake, and here, out of the sunshine, yet handy
to fill, stood his creation. Its double walls of
poles were stuffed with moss, its roof chinked with
blue clay, a sliding door gave ingress, and even
now, with summer almost gone, an ample supply
of ice remained in it.</p>

<p>In the division of duties among these campers,
Levi usually started the morning fire while Old
Cy visited the ice-house for anything needed. One
morning after the new cabin was completed, he
came here as usual.</p>

<p>A fine string of trout caught by Martin and
Ray the day before were hanging in this ice-house,
and securing what was needed, Old Cy
closed the door and turned away. As usual
with him, he glanced up and down the narrow
beach to see if a deer had wandered along there
that morning, and in doing so he now saw, close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
the water&#8217;s edge and distinctly outlined in the damp
sand, the print of a moccasined foot.</p>

<p>It was of extra large size, and as Old Cy bent
over it, he saw it had recently been made. Glancing
along toward the head of this cove, he saw
more tracks, and two rods away, the sharp furrow
of a canoe prow in the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that pesky half-breed, sure&#8217;s a gun,&#8221; he
muttered, stooping over the track, &#8220;fer a good
bit o&#8217; his legs was turned up to walk on, and he
wore moccasins t&#8217;other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curious now, and somewhat startled, he looked
along where the narrow beach curved out and
around to the landing, and saw the tracks led
that way. Then picking his way so as not to
obscure them, he followed until not three rods
from the new cabin they left the beach and were
plainly visible behind a couple of spruces, in the
soft carpet of needles, which was crushed for a
small space, where some one had stood.</p>

<p>Returning to camp, Old Cy motioned to Levi
and Martin. All three returned to the ice-house,
looked where the canoe had cut its furrow, took
up the trail to its ending beside the two trees, and
then glanced into one another&#8217;s eyes with serious,
sobered, troubled faces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>And well they might; for the evening previous
they had all been grouped upon the piazza of this
new cabin until late, while scarce three rods away
a spying enemy, presumably this half-breed, had
stood and watched them.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;Blessed be them that &#8217;spects nothin&#8217;, they won&#8217;t git
fooled.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Christmas Cove</span> was never disturbed by aught
except small boats, and few of them. It was a
long, crescent-shaped arm of the sea, parallel to
the ocean, and separated from it by a spruce-clad
cliff; its placid surface scarcely more than rippled
or undulated outside, and so shallow was it that
each ebb tide left its sandy bottom bare.</p>

<p>A stream found devious way along this crescent
when the outflow left it bare. Mottled minnows,
schools of white and green smelts, crabs of all
sorts and sizes, swam and sported up and down
this broad, shallow brook while the tide was
away, and few of human kind ever watched
them.</p>

<p>Alongside this cove and inward a dozen or more
brown houses and a few white ones faced its curving
shore, a broad street with many elms and ruts
between which the grass grew separated the houses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
and cove, and a small white church with a gilt
fish for weather-vane on its steeple stood midway
of these dwellings.</p>

<p>A low range of green hills to the northward of
this village shut off the wintry winds, at the upper
end of the street a stream from a cleft in the hills
crossed it, and here stood a mill, its roof green
with moss, its clapboards brown and whitened
with mill dust, the log dam above it half obscured
by willows. To the right of this a short flume
was entirely hidden by alders, and above the dam
lay a pond, entirely covered with green lily-pads,
and dotted by white blossoms all summer.</p>

<p>Beside the mill and nearer the roadway stood
an ancient dwelling, also moss-coated; two giant
elms shaded it, and the entire impression conveyed
by the mill&#8217;s drowsy rumble and splashing
wheel on a hot August afternoon was&#8211;find a
shady spot and take a nap.</p>

<p>These were the summer conditions existent at
Christmas Cove. The winter ones may be left
undescribed.</p>

<p>Just beyond where the mill stream crossed the
road the highway divided, one fork following the
trend of these hills to where a railroad crossed
them, ten miles away; the other, running close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
to the upper and marshy end of Christmas Cove
to where a spile bridge connected the two uplands
and thence over to another village called Bayport.
This, the larger of the two, had once contained a
shipyard, now idle, a score of its dwellings were
vacant, and the two hundred or more of its population
existed by farming, fishing, lobster-catching,
and a small factory devoted to the production of
sardines duly labelled with a French name.</p>

<p>Christmas Cove, however, was more respectable,
with its hundred residents, mostly retired sea captains
with an income, and no litter of lobster pots
or nets to obstruct its one long, narrow wharf
which reached out to deep water at the mouth of
the cove. A few small pleasure craft were tethered
to the wharf, and gardens, cows, and poultry
were merely diversions here.</p>

<p>One other income it had, however, which was considered
less plebeian than Bayport&#8217;s&#8211;the money a
score of city-bred people left each summer.</p>

<p>Keeping boarders was all right at Christmas Cove.
It did not smack of trade and commerce. No
smoke of engines, no dust of coal, no noise of hammer
and saw, were parts of it. No odor from a canning
factory, no wrack of dismantled boats, tarred nets,
and broken traps, was connected with it. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
dwellings at Christmas Cove were roomy, few children
were now a part of its population&#8211;scarce
enough to fill the one schoolhouse presided over by
Mr. Bell, and so each season a few dozen of the
uneasy horde, always anxious to leave home and
board somewhere, came here.</p>

<p>A daily stage line&#8211;an ancient carryall drawn by
one sleepy horse&#8211;connected this village with the
railroad. Its church bell called the faithful to
Thursday evening prayer-meeting and Sunday service
with unfailing regularity. Its one general store
and post-office combined, was the evening rendezvous
for a score of sea captains&#8211;grizzled hulks
who had sailed into safe harbor here at last, and who
watched the weather, discussed the visitors, and
swapped yarns year in and year out.</p>

<p>Here also, many years before, when Bayport was
more prosperous, the threads of a romance had been
woven, and two brothers, Judson and Cyrus Walker,
born at Bayport, and sailing out of it, had paid court
to two sisters, Abigail and Amanda Grey, here at
Christmas Cove.</p>

<p>It was, as such sailors&#8217; courtships ever are, intermittent.
Six, eight, and sometimes twelve months
marked its interims, until finally only one brother,
Judson, returned to announce a shipwreck in mid-ocean,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
a separation of their crew in two boats, and
Abbie Grey, whom Cyrus had smiled upon, was left
to wait and watch and hope.</p>

<p>In time, also, Judson and &#8220;Mandy&#8221; joined fortunes.
In time, and after many voyages, during
which he vainly tried to find some tidings of his
brother, Judson, now Captain Walker, gave up the
sea, and with wife and two young sons retired
inland, purchased an abandoned farm in a sequestered
valley, and began another life.</p>

<p>Another mating had also occurred at Christmas
Cove, for Abbie, the other sister and the sweetheart
of Cyrus, giving him up for lost, finally consented to
share the ancestral home of Captain Bemis&#8211;once
a sailor and now the miller, who had exchanged the
sea&#8217;s perils for that peaceful vocation.</p>

<p>His father had ground grist here for a lifetime, and
passed on. His mother still survived when Abbie
Grey, once the belle of the village and a boarding-school
graduate, married Captain Bemis, twice her
age, and her old-time romance became only a
memory.</p>

<p>No children came to fill this great, cheerless house
with laughter. The old mother was laid away in
due time, Abbie, once a handsome girl, grew portly
and became Aunt Abbie to neighboring children,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
and finally all the village; and disappointed as she
had cause to be, she turned her thoughts to good
works and religion.</p>

<p>But Cyrus, adrift in an open boat with half the
crew, was finally rescued by a whaler, after starvation
had left him almost an imbecile. A four-year,
compulsory voyage to southern seas followed; then
another wreck and a year on an island, and then a
chance meeting with another sailor from Bayport,
and from whom he learned two unpleasant facts,&#8211;first
that his sweetheart, Abbie Grey, was married;
and secondly that his brother had been lost at sea.</p>

<p>One was true, of course, and somewhat disheartening
to Cyrus; the other, as discomforting, but not
true. It was simply a case of mistaken identity,
his own disappearance being confounded with that
of his brother.</p>

<p>This story served the purpose of so affecting
Cyrus that he resolved never to set foot in either
Christmas Cove or Bayport, and also never to allow
any one there to know that he was alive.</p>

<p>From now on, also, he deserted the sea and became
a wanderer. He first lived in the wilderness, where
as trapper and hunter and lumberman he learned
the woodsman&#8217;s habits; and when mid-life was
reached, having become sceptical of all things, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
finally settled down at Greenvale. Here, loving
children and the woods, fields, brooks, and Nature
more than raiment, religion, and respectability, he
became a village nondescript, a social outcast, and&#8211;Old Cy Walker.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The poor &#8217;n&#8217; pious kin callate the crumbs fallin&#8217; from the
rich man&#8217;s table&#8217;ll be few &#8217;n&#8217; skimpy.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>An</span> enemy we can meet in the open need not appall
us; but an enemy who creeps up to us by day, or
still worse by night, in a vast wilderness, becomes a
panther and an Indian combined.</p>

<p>Such a one had spied upon Martin&#8217;s camp that
night, and all the tales of this half-breed&#8217;s cunning
and fierce nature, told by Levi, were now recalled.
Like a human brute whose fangs were tobacco-stained,
whose one evil eye glared at them out of
darkness, the half-breed had now become a creeping,
crawling beast, impossible to trail, yet certain
to bide his time, seize Chip, or avenge her loss upon
her protectors.</p>

<p>Now another complication arose as Martin, Old
Cy, and Levi left the spot where this enemy had
watched them&#8211;what to do about Angie and the
girl? From the first warning from Levi that they
were in danger from the half-breed, Martin had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
avoided all hint of it to them. Now they must be
told, and all peace of mind at once destroyed.
Concealment was no longer possible, however, and
when Angie was told, her face paled. Her first
intuition, and as the sequel proved, a wise one, was
for them to at once pack up and quit the woods as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p>But Martin was of different fibre. To run away
like this was cowardly, and besides he cherished
only contempt for a wretch who had played the rôle
of this fellow, and was so vile of instinct. With
no desire to do wrong, he yet felt that if sufficient
provocation and the need of self-defence arose, the
earth, and especially this wilderness, would be well
rid of such a despicable creature.</p>

<p>Then Levi&#8217;s advice carried weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to &#8217;scape him,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by
startin&#8217; out o&#8217; the woods now. Most likely he&#8217;s
got his eye on us this minute. He knows every
rod o&#8217; the way out whar we&#8217;d be likely to camp.
He&#8217;d sure follow, an&#8217; if he didn&#8217;t cut our canoes to
pieces some night, he&#8217;d watch his chance &#8217;n&#8217; grab
the gal &#8217;n&#8217; make off under cover o&#8217; darkness. We&#8217;ve
got a sort o&#8217; human panther to figger on, an&#8217; shootin&#8217;
under such conditions might mean killin&#8217; the gal.
We&#8217;ve got to go out sometime, but I don&#8217;t believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
in turnin&#8217; tail fust go-off, &#8217;n&#8217; we may get a chance to
wing the cuss, like ez not,&#8221; and the glitter in Levi&#8217;s
eyes showed he would not hesitate to shoot this
half-breed if the chance presented itself.</p>

<p>Old Cy&#8217;s opinion is also worth quoting:&#8211;&#8220;My
notion is this hyena&#8217;s a coward, &#8217;n&#8217; like all
sich&#8217;ll never show himself by daylight. He knows
we&#8217;ve got guns &#8217;n&#8217; know how to use &#8217;em. The
camp&#8217;s as good as a fort. One on us kin allus be
on guard daytimes, an&#8217; when it&#8217;s time to go out&#8211;wal,
I think we ought to hev cunnin&#8217; &#8217;nuff &#8217;mongst
us to gin one hyena the slip. Thar&#8217;s one thing
must be done, though, &#8217;n&#8217; that is, keep the gal
clus. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t do to let her go over the hog-back
arter berries, or canoein&#8217; round the lake no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now began a state of semi-siege at Birch
Camp.</p>

<p>Chip was kept an almost prisoner, hardly ever
permitted out of Angie&#8217;s sight. One of the men,
always with rifle handy, remained on guard&#8211;usually
Old Cy, and for a few nights he lay in ambush
near the shore, to see if perchance this enemy would
steal up again.</p>

<p>With all these precautions against surprise, came
a certain feeling of defiance in Martin. With Ray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
for companion he went fishing once more, and with
Levi as pilot he cruised about for game.</p>

<p>Only a few more weeks of his outing remained,
and on sober second thought, he didn&#8217;t mean to let
this sneaking enemy spoil those.</p>

<p>But Old Cy never relaxed his vigil. This waif of
the wilderness and her pitiful position appealed to
him even more than to Angie, and true to the nature
that had made all Greenvale&#8217;s children love him, so
now did Chip find him a kind and protecting father.</p>

<p>With rifle always with him, he took her canoeing
and fishing; sometimes Angie joined them, and so
life at Birch Camp became pleasant once more.</p>

<p>A week or more of happiness was passed, with no
sight or sign of their enemy, and then one morning
when Old Cy had journeyed over to the ice-house,
he glanced across the lake to a narrow valley through
which a stream known as Beaver Brook reached the
lake, and far up this vale, rising above the dense
woods, was a faint column of smoke.</p>

<p>The morning was damp, cloudy, and still&#8211;conditions
suitable for smoke-rising, and yet so faint
and distant was this that none but the keen, observant
eyes of a woodsman would have noticed it.
Yet there it was, a thin white pillar, clearly outlined
against the dark green of the foliage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>Old Cy hurried back, motioned to Levi, and the
two watched it from the front of the camp. Martin
soon joined them, then Angie and Chip, and all
stood and studied this smoke sign. It was almost
ludicrous, and yet not; for at its foot must be a fire,
and beside it, doubtless, the half-breed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you locate it?&#8221; queried Martin of his
guide, as the delicate column of white slowly
faded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s purty well up the brook,&#8221; Levi answered;
&#8220;thar&#8217;s a sort of Rocky Dundar thar, &#8217;n&#8217; probably
a cave. I callate if it&#8217;s him, he&#8217;s s&#8217;pected a storm,
&#8217;n&#8217; so sneaked to cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, as if to prove this, a few drops of rain
began to patter on the motionless lake; thicker,
faster they came, and as the little group hurried to
shelter, a torrent, almost, descended. For weeks
not a drop of rain had fallen here. Each morn the
sun had risen in undimmed splendor, to vanish at
night, a ball of glorious red.</p>

<p>But now a change had come. Wind followed
the rain, and all that day the storm raged and roared
through the dense forest about. The lake was
white with driving scud, the cabin rocked, trees
creaked, and outdoor life was impossible. When
night came, it seemed a thousand demons were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
wailing, moaning, and screeching in the forest, and
as the little party now grouped around the open
stove in the new cabin watched it, the fire rose and
fell in unison with the blasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the spites,&#8221; whispered Chip to Ray. &#8220;They
allus act that way when it&#8217;s stormin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the gale began to lessen, and by
night the moon, now half full, peeped out of the
scurrying clouds. At bedtime it was smiling serenely,
well down toward the tree-tops, and Chip&#8217;s
spites had ceased their wailing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, Martin&#8217;s quest for game
had been successful. A saddle of venison, a dozen
or more partridges, and two goodly strings of trout
hung in cold storage.</p>

<p>But utter and almost speechless astonishment
awaited Old Cy at the ice-house when he visited it
the next morning, for the venison was gone, not a
bird remained, and one of the two strings of trout
had vanished.</p>

<p>In front, on the sand, was the same tell-tale moccasin
tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, by the Great Horn Spoon! if that cuss
hain&#8217;t swiped the hull business,&#8221; Old Cy ejaculated,
as he looked in and then at the tracks. &#8220;Crossed
over last night,&#8221; he added, noting where a canoe had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
cut its furrow, &#8220;an&#8217; steered plumb for my ice-house!
The varmint!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Martin was angry, thoroughly angry, at the
audacious insolence of the theft, and the thought
that just now this sneaking half-breed was doubtless
enjoying grilled venison and roast partridge in some
secure shelter. It also opened his eyes to the fact
that this chap would hang about, watching his
chance, until they started out of the wilderness, and
then capture the girl if he could. For a little while
Martin pondered over the situation and then announced
his plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s law, and officers to execute it,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;if a sufficient reward be offered; and to-morrow you
and I, Levi, will start for the settlement and fetch
a couple in. I&#8217;ll gladly give five hundred dollars
to land this sneak behind the bars. If he can&#8217;t be
caught, we can at least have two officers to guard us
going out.&#8221;</p>

<p>All that day he and Levi spent in hunting. Another
deer was captured, more birds secured, and
when evening came plans to meet the situation were
discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You or Ray must remain on guard daytimes
near the cabin,&#8221; Martin said to Old Cy. &#8220;My
wife and Chip had better keep in it, or near it most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
of the time; and both of you must sleep there nights.
One or the other can fish or hunt, as needed. We
must be gone a week or more, even if we have good
luck; but fetching the officers here is the best plan
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Levi was up early the next morning, and had the
best canoe packed for a hurry trip ere breakfast was
ready. No tent was to be taken, only blankets, a
rifle, a bag of the simplest cooking utensils, pork,
bread, and coffee. A modest outfit&#8211;barely enough
to sustain life, yet all a woodsman carries when a
long canoe journey with many carries must be taken.</p>

<p>There were sober faces at the landing when Martin
was ready to start,&#8211;Chip most sober of all,&#8211;for
now she realized as never before how serious a
burden she had become.</p>

<p>No time was wasted in good-bys. Martin
grasped the bow paddle, and with &#8220;Old Faithful&#8221;
Levi wielding the stern one, they soon crossed the
lake and vanished at its outlet.</p>

<p>And now, also, for the first time, Angie realized
how much the presence of these two strong and
resourceful men meant to her. All that day she and
Chip clung to the cabin, while Old Cy, a long, lanky
Leatherstocking, patrolled the premises, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hain&#8217;t a mite o&#8217; cause to worry,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
when nightfall drew near. &#8220;That pesky varmint&#8217;s
a coward, &#8217;n&#8217; knows guns are plenty here, an&#8217; we
folks handy in usin&#8217; &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve rigged a fish line to
the ice-house door, so it&#8217;ll rattle some tinware in the
cabin if he meddles it again. I sleep with one eye
&#8217;n&#8217; both ears open, an&#8217; if he comes prowlin&#8217; round
night-times, he&#8217;ll hear bullets whizzin&#8217; an&#8217; think
Fourth o&#8217; July&#8217;s opened up arly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for all his cheerful assurance, time passed
slowly, and a sense of real danger oppressed Angie
and Chip as well. Ray shared it also. He was not
as yet hardened to the wilderness, and like all who
are thus tender, its vast sombre solitude seemed
ominous.</p>

<p>Only the hermit, with his moonlike eyes and impassive
ways, showed no sign of trouble. What
this half-breed wanted, other than food, he seemed
not to understand; and while he helped about the
camp work and followed Old Cy like a dog, he was
of no other aid.</p>

<p>One, two, three days of watchful guard and
evenings when even Old Cy&#8217;s cheerful philosophy
or Ray&#8217;s banjo failed to dispel the gloom, and then,
just as the sun was setting once again, a canoe with
one occupant was seen to enter the lake and head
for the landing.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The more I see o&#8217; the world, the better I like the
woods.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Martin&#8217;s</span> journey to the settlement was a rushing
one. The first day they wielded paddles without
rest, and aided by the current made rapid progress.
Both carries were passed before sunset, a halt made
for a supper of frizzled pork, coffee, and hard tack;
then on again by moonlight, and not until wearied
to the limit at almost midnight did they pause, and
hiding themselves in the entrance to an old tote
road, they slept the sleep of weariness.</p>

<p>Tim&#8217;s Place was sighted the next day, and now,
at Levi&#8217;s suggestion, Martin lay down in the canoe
as they passed it, concealed beneath a blanket.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best to be keerful,&#8221; Levi said, when proposing
this; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust Tim a minute. Most
likely he&#8217;s found out whar the gal is, an&#8217; knows what
Pete&#8217;s up to. The two are cahoots together, &#8217;n&#8217; if
Tim saw you an&#8217; I both leavin&#8217;, no tellin&#8217; what&#8217;d
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The journey from here on was slower, as no current
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
aided, and yet in three days and nights of
paddling, Martin and Levi covered that hundred-mile
journey and reached the settlement.</p>

<p>A stage and rail journey, consuming one day and
night more, enabled Martin to reach the man he
wanted&#8211;a well-informed and fearless officer named
Hersey, and then, securing an assistant and a warrant
for one Pete Bolduc, on the charge of theft,
the three returned to the settlement where Levi had
waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to get track of this half-breed,&#8221; Hersey
said on the way. &#8220;He has been the pal of the notorious
McGuire for many years, and besides has been
smuggling whiskey into lumber camps and slaughtering
game out of season all the time. Like
McGuire, he is hard to locate. No guide or lumberman
dare betray him, and so it&#8217;s a fruitless task
to try to catch either. We have been after this
McGuire for years. He killed one deputy and
wounded another, as you may have heard. This
Bolduc is a cat of the same color, but less courageous,
I fancy, and yet as hard to catch. I think, for
the sake of your guide,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we&#8217;d better not
enter the woods together. You two go on, saying
nothing. My mate and I will say we are on a pleasure
trip, and follow and overtake you in a few hours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
This will protect your man, and evade suspicion.
Even these people at the settlement are half-hearted
in aiding an officer. Most of them are fearful of
house or barn burning if they give any information
to us, a few are in secret league with these outlaws;
and so you see our position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin saw, and marvelled that any of the simple,
honest dwellers at this small settlement, law-abiding
as they seemed, would either aid or warn so red-handed
a criminal as McGuire.</p>

<p>That fear of consequences might influence them,
was possible, and yet all the more reason for
assisting the law in ridding the forest of two such
criminals.</p>

<p>But Martin, thorough sportsman that he was, and
keen to all the world&#8217;s affairs, understood but little
of the conditions existent in the wilderness, or about
the lives and morals of those who find a living
thus.</p>

<p>He knew, as all do, that a few thousand lumbermen
entered each autumn, and, much to his regret,
made steady inroads toward its despoilment. He
knew, also, that these men included many of excellent
habits&#8211;sober, industrious workers with families
which they cheerfully supported, and that there
were also many among them whose sole ambition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
was to earn a few hundred dollars in a season of
hard work, that they might spend it in a few weeks,
or even days, of drunken debauchery.</p>

<p>He was well aware that a few wandering hunters
and trappers plied their calling here, and many of
a mixed occupation, guiding sportsmen like himself
in season, were engaged in lumbering or farming
between times. This mixed and transient population,
he knew, were neither better nor worse than
the average of such pioneers&#8211;good-natured and
good-hearted, though somewhat lax in speech and
morals.</p>

<p>What he did not know, however, was that a few
unscrupulous and disreputable men, half gamblers,
half dive-keepers, followed these lumbermen into
camp as ostensible hunters and trappers, but really
gamblers, ready to turn a trick at cards, convoy a
keg of whiskey in, or follow a moose on snow-shoes,
kill and sell him, as occasion offered. Or that,
when spring opened the streams, these same itinerant
purveyors of vice spotted their possible victims,
as a bunco man does a rural &#8220;good thing&#8221; visiting
the metropolis, and when they reached town or
city, steered them where harpies waited to share
the spoil. A brief explanation of these facts were
furnished to Martin by Warden Hersey, when,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
after overhauling him, the parties joined about one
camp-fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; Hersey said, &#8220;in the case of this
McGuire, a fair sample of the outcome liable to
follow or attach to a man who makes a business of
preying upon the vices and follies of the lumbering
class. It is a sort of evolution in law-evasion and
opportunity, encouraged and aided by the animosity
which is sure to arise between the lumberman and us,
whose duty it is to enforce the fish and game laws.
These lumbermen, or a majority of them, feel and
believe that the forest and all it contains is theirs by
natural right; that no law forbidding them to obtain
all the fish and game they can, is just; that such laws
are enacted and accrue for the sole benefit of city
sportsmen who, like yourself, come here for rest and
recreation. It is all a wrong conclusion, as we know,
and yet it exists. Now come these leeches like
McGuire, who prey upon this hard-working class.
Such as McGuire foster the prejudice and antagonism
of the lumbermen in all ways possible, arguing
that moose and deer are the natural perquisites of
those who go into the woods for a livelihood, and
belong to them as much as the trees which they have
paid stumpage to cut. Also that we who come in
to execute the laws are interlopers, who draw pay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
for the sole purpose of robbing them of their rights.
Of course, we receive no welcome at a lumbering
camp, and not one iota of information as to what is
going on or where a law-breaker may be found.
More than that, they will protect the leeches who
fatten on them in every way possible, even after, as
in McGuire&#8217;s case, they become murderers and outlaws,
with a price set upon their capture. And here
comes in the factor of terrorism. A few of these
lumbermen might give information from a desire
to aid the law, or to obtain a reward, did they not
know that to do so would expose them to the inevitable
fate of all betrayers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a community of interest, a sort of freemasonry
that exists between these lumbermen and
all who thrive upon their labors and hardships.
Now this McGuire has preyed upon them for years,
a notorious example of dive-keeper, gambler,
smuggler, and pot-hunter. He is now in hiding
somewhere in this wilderness, or, maybe, creeping
up some stream with a canoe load of liquor bought
in some Canadian town. He will meet and be welcomed
by any lumber-cutting party just making
camp next fall, sell them liquor at exorbitant prices,
shoot and sell them venison, and when the snow is
deep enough, he will follow and find moose yards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
and do a wholesale slaughter act, and not satisfied
with this, will absorb any and all money these lumbermen
have left by card games. And yet the
moment I enter the woods to arrest him, their
camps are closed to me, and word of my coming is
passed along to others. The guides even, who are
at the beck and call of you sportsmen, are, many
of them, in secret sympathy with such as McGuire;
or if not, dare not give any clews, and many a wild-goose
chase has resulted from following their supposed
information. Some of the wisest among
them are beginning to realize that they must cooperate
with us in the protection of fish and game,
or their occupation will be gone. But even those
sensible fellows&#8211;and they are increasing&#8211;hate
to become informer, fearing consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still another side to this game situation,&#8221;
continued Hersey, filling and lighting his pipe, &#8220;and
this is our laws, or rather, the selfishness of our lawmakers.
We have plenty of laws&#8211;and good
ones. We impose a license tax upon all non-residents
for the privilege of shooting or fishing. We
limit the season and number of moose, deer, or trout
which may be taken. This license, which is all
right, produces an annual fund sufficient to employ
ten wardens, where the State only employs one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
The result is that this vast wilderness is so poorly
patrolled that a game warden is as much of a rarity
as a white deer. Now and then one may be seen
canoeing up or down some main stream, or loafing
a week or two at some backwoods farm and having
a good time. One may certainly be found at all
points of egress; but a portion of the wilderness&#8211;the
greater way-back region&#8211;is rarely visited by
wardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still one more point, and that is the pay
which wardens receive. It is so small that capable,
honest men cannot be obtained for what the State
allows; and considering the large sums raised from
this license tax, it is a mere pittance. The result
is, we have to employ a class of men, many of whom
are no respecters of the law themselves, or who may
be bribed.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a full and complete explanation of the conditions
then existing in the wilderness, and as Martin
glanced at &#8220;Old Faithful&#8221; Levi lounging on his
elbow, he understood why that astute guide had
always avoided all possible reference to McGuire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This half-breed, Bolduc, is another sample of
his class,&#8221; continued Hersey, &#8220;and while we have
no criminal charge, we can prove we know he is
a pot-hunter, and I&#8217;ll be glad to nab him, for an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
example. I judge he is lurking about your camp,
watching a chance to abduct this girl, and while it&#8217;s
an unusual case, it may serve our purpose nicely&#8211;a
sort of bait, useful in alluring him into our hands.
How we can catch him, however, is not an easy
problem. He knows the forest far better than we
do; every stream, lake, defile, or cave is familiar to
him, and, cunning as a fox, all pursuit would be
useless. Our only hope is to patrol the woods
about your camp as hunters, or watch for another
night visit, and halt him, at the muzzle of a rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Martin turned the conversation to a more
interesting subject&#8211;Chip herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the girl at Tim&#8217;s Place,&#8221; Hersey said,
&#8220;and knowing her ancestry, felt curious to observe
her. She appeared bright as a new dollar and a
willing worker for Tim. Of course, it seemed unfortunate
that she should be left to grow up there
without education; and while her natural guardian
being an outlaw gave the State an ample right to
interfere, the proper officer has never seen fit to do
so. It has been a case of &#8216;out of sight, out of mind,&#8217;
I presume, and while we have a law obliging parents
to send their children to public schools so many
months a year until a certain age, this is a case where
no one has seen fit to enforce it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>&#8220;But what about her parents?&#8221; queried Martin,
curious on this point. &#8220;Do you know whether they
were legally married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no-o, only by hearsay,&#8221; Hersey responded.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told her mother was a Nova Scotia girl,
a mill worker in one of our larger cities, and as no
one ever hinted otherwise, I think it safe to assume
that they were married. If not, there would surely
have been some one to spread the sinister fact. It&#8217;s
the way of the world. I presume Tim knows the
girl&#8217;s history, but he is such a surly Irishman that I
never questioned him. In fact, his surroundings,
as you may have noticed, do not invite long visits.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no visit or even halt at Tim&#8217;s Place was now
considered advisable. In fact, as Levi said, it was
best to pass that spot at midnight. This suggestion
was carried out, and in five days from leaving the
settlement, Martin and the officers made their last
camp at the lake where he had once seen a spectral
canoeist.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;A swelled heart may cost ye money, but a swelled head&#8217;ll
cost ye ten times more.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>An</span> unexpected canoe entering a lake so secluded
and so seldom visited as this lake must needs awaken
the keenest surprise, and especially in the case of a
party situated as this one was. Ray, who had just
returned from a berry-picking trip over at the &#8220;blow
down,&#8221; and Old Cy, carrying his suggestive rifle, were
at the landing some time before this canoe reached
it, while Angie and Chip waited almost breathlessly
on the cabin piazza. A stout, bare-headed Indian,
clad in white man&#8217;s raiment, was paddling. He
glanced at the two awaiting him at the landing, with
big black, emotionless eyes, and then up to the
cabin.</p>

<p>As his canoe now grated on the sandy beach close
by, he laid aside his paddle, stepped forward and
out, drew his craft well up, and folding his arms
glanced at Old Cy again, as if waiting for a welcome.
None was needed, however, for on the instant,
almost, came an exclamation of joy from Chip, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
with a &#8220;Hullo, Poppy Tomah,&#8221; she was down the
bank, with both her hands in his.</p>

<p>A faint smile of welcome spread over his austere
face as he looked down at the girl, but not a word,
as yet, came.</p>

<p>Old Cy, quick to see that he was a friend, now
advanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to see ye,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; as ye seem
to be a friend o&#8217; the gal&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll make ye welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian bowed low, and a &#8220;How do,&#8221; like
a grunt, was his answer. A calm, slow, motionless
type of a now almost extinct race, as he seemed to be,
he would utter no word or move a step farther until
invited. But now, led by Chip, he advanced up the
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Tomah, old Poppy Tomah,&#8221; she said with
pride, as Angie rose to meet them, &#8220;and he&#8217;s the
only body who was ever good to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, sir,&#8221; Angie said, with a
gracious bow and smile, &#8220;and you are welcome here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank the white lady&#8211;I not forget,&#8221; came the
Indian&#8217;s dignified answer with a stately bow.</p>

<p>Not a word of greeting for Chip or of surprise
at finding her here&#8211;only the eagle glance, accustomed
to bright sunlight or to following the flight
of a bird far out of white man&#8217;s vision.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>&#8220;We shall have supper soon,&#8221; Angie added,
uncertain what to say to this impassive man, &#8220;and
some for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a deft speech, for Angie, accustomed to take
in every detail of a man from the condition of his
nails to the cut of his clothing, as all women will, had
ere now absorbed the appearance of this swarthy
redskin, and was not quite sure whether to invite
him to share their table or say nothing.</p>

<p>But the Indian solved his own problem, for spying
the outdoor fire to which Old Cy now retreated,
he bowed again and strode away toward it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me cook here?&#8221; he said to Old Cy. With an
&#8220;Of course, an&#8217; you&#8217;re welcome to,&#8221; the question
was settled.</p>

<p>Chip soon drew near, and now for the first time
the Indian&#8217;s speech seemed to return, and while Old
Cy busied himself about the cooking, these two began
to visit.</p>

<p>Chip, as might be expected, did most of the talking,
asked questions as to Tim&#8217;s Place, when he was
there, and what they said about her running
away, in rapid succession. Her own adventures
and how she came here soon followed, and it was
not long before he knew all that was to be known
about her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>His replies were blunt and brief, after the manner
of such. Now and then an expressive nod or grunt
filled in the place of an ordinary answer. He knew
but little about the recent happenings at Tim&#8217;s
Place, as he had stayed there only one night since
Chip departed with her father&#8211;as he was told.
He had been away in the woods, looking for
places to set traps later, and had no idea Chip
was here.</p>

<p>As to Pete&#8217;s movements, he was equally in the
dark, and when Chip told him what her friends here
suspected, he merely grunted. As he seemed to wish
to do his own cooking, Old Cy, having completed his
task, offered him a partridge and a couple of trout
fresh from the ice-house, also pork and potatoes,
and left him to care for himself.</p>

<p>He became more sociable later, and when supper
was over and the rest had, as usual, gathered on the
piazza of the new cabin, he joined them.</p>

<p>And now came a recital from Ray of far more
interest to these people than they suspected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a bear over back of the ridge this afternoon,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;or I don&#8217;t know but it was a wildcat.
I&#8217;d just filled my pail with berries, when way
up, close to the rocks, I saw something moving. I
crouched down back of a bush, thinking it might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
a bear, and if it was, I&#8217;d get a chance to see it nearer.
I could only see the top of its back above the bushes,
and once I saw its head, as if it was standing up.
Then I didn&#8217;t see it for quite a spell, and then I
caught sight of its back again, a good deal nearer, and
then it went into one of the gullies in the hog-back.
I didn&#8217;t wait to see if it came out, but cut for
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did this critter sorter wobble like a woodchuck
runnin&#8217;?&#8221; put in Old Cy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it just crept along evenly,&#8221; answered Ray,
&#8220;I&#8217;d see it when it would come out between the
bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twa&#8217;n&#8217;t a b&#8217;ar,&#8221; muttered Old Cy, and then,
as if the unwisdom of waking suspicion in Angie&#8217;s
mind occurred, he added hastily, &#8220;but mebbe &#8217;twas
a doe, walkin&#8217; head down &#8217;n&#8217; feedin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>No further notice was taken of Ray&#8217;s adventure.
The sight of deer everywhere about was a ten-times-daily
occurrence, and Old Cy&#8217;s dismissal of the
matter ended it.</p>

<p>His thoughts, however, were a different matter.
Full well he knew it was no bear thus moving. A
deer would never enter a crevasse, nor a wildcat or
lynx ever leave the shelter of woods to wander in
open sunlight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over thar in the mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he said to himself;
&#8220;I may git a chance to wing that varmint &#8217;n&#8217;
end our worryin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Angie, more interested in spites and the
weird belief which she heard that this Indian held
than in the sight of a doe, began to ply Old Tomah
with questions, and bit by bit she led him on toward
that subject.</p>

<p>It was not an easy task. His speech came slowly.
Deeds, not words, are an Indian&#8217;s form of expression,
and this fair white lady, serene as the moon
and as suave and smiling as culture could make her,
was one to awe him.</p>

<p>With Chip he had been fluent enough. She had
been almost a protégée of his, a big pappoose whom
he had taught to manage a canoe, for whom he had
made moccasins, a fur cap and cape, who had listened
to all his strange theories with wide-open,
believing eyes, and, best of all, a helpless waif whom
he had learned to love.</p>

<p>But this white lady, awe-inspiring as she was, now
failed to induce him to talk.</p>

<p>Chip, however, keen to catch the drift of Angie&#8217;s
wishes and anxious to have her own faith defended,
soon came to the rescue and induced Old Tomah to
speak&#8211;not fluently at first, the &#8220;me&#8221; in place of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
&#8220;I&#8221; always occurring, adjectives following nouns,
prepositions left out in many cases; and yet, as he
warmed up to his subject, his coal-black eyes were
fierce or tender, and the inborn eloquence of his
race glowed in face and speech.</p>

<p>And what a wild tale he told! Some of it was
the history of his own race, beginning long before
white men came. He related the contests of his
people with wild animals, their deeds of valor, their
torturing of prisoners, their own scorn of death and
stoical endurance of pain. His own ancestors had
been mighty chieftains. They had led the tribe
through many battles, swept down upon their white
enemies, an avenging horde, and were now roaming
the happy hunting-grounds where he would soon
join them. Mingled with this tale of warfare and
conquest, and always an unseen force for good or
evil, were the spites&#8211;the souls of all brute creation.
How they followed or led the hunter! How
they warned their own kind of his coming! How
they lured him into unseen danger, and how they continually
sought to avenge their own deaths! There
were also two kinds of them,&#8211;some evil and the
others good. The evil ones predominated, the
good ones feared them, yet sought to interfere in all
evil effort. These two hosts also had their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
warfares. They fought oftenest when storms raged
in the forest. Then they swept the tree-tops and
scurried over the hills in vast numbers, shrieking
and screaming defiance.</p>

<p>Another apparition was oft referred to in this
weird talk. A great white spectre and chieftain of
all spites, who sprang from his abode in the north,
whose breath was a blast of snow, howling as it
swept over the wilderness&#8211;this ghost, so vast that
it covered miles and miles of wilderness, was altogether
evil. It spared neither man nor beast.
The hunter trailing his game met death on the instant
and was left rigid and upright in his tracks.
Squaws and children huddled in wigwams shared
the same speedy fate. Lynxes and panthers, deer
and moose by the score, were touched by the same
mystic and awful wand of death.</p>

<p>It was all an uncanny, eerie, ghostly recital; yet
all real and true to Chip, whose eyes never once left
the Indian&#8217;s face while he was speaking. Angie,
too, was spellbound. Never had she heard anything
like it; and while believing it was all a mere
myth and legend, a superstitious fancy, maybe, of
this strange Indian, its telling was none the less
interesting.</p>

<p>Ray was also enthralled, and he was half convinced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
that the forest might, after all, contain spooks and
goblins.</p>

<p>But Old Cy was only a curious listener. He, too,
had woven many a fantastic tale of the sea, its storms
and monsters leaping from the crests of waves, and
all such figments of the imagination, and this fable
was but the same. The only feature of passing
interest to him was the fact that any Indian had
such a vivid imagination and could relate such a
mingled ghost story so coherently.</p>

<p>Old Tomah ceased speaking even more abruptly
than he began, then looked from one to another of
the group, perhaps to see if they all believed him,
and then without a word or even &#8220;good night,&#8221; he
rose and stalked out of the cabin.</p>

<p>For a few moments Chip watched Angie and the
rest, anxious to see how this explanation of her own
belief affected them, and then Old Cy spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be campin&#8217; with that Injun,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;or sharin&#8217; a wigwam with him night-times.
It &#8217;ud be worse&#8217;n a man I sot up with once that had
the jim-jams, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;d see spites and spooks for a week
arter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angie&#8217;s sleep was troubled that night, and in her
dreams she saw white spectres and a man with a
hideously scarred face and one eye watching her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>Ray also felt the uncanny influence of such a
tale and &#8220;saw things&#8221; in his sleep. But Old Cy,
who had securely barred the doors and then had
rolled himself in a blanket with rifle handy, thought
only of what Ray had seen that day and who it
might be.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;An honest man&#8217;s the best critter God ever made, an&#8217; the
skeercest.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Old Cy&#8217;s</span> suspicions were correct. It was neither
bear, deer, nor wildcat that Ray saw skulking along
the ridge, but the half-breed.</p>

<p>Believing Chip&#8217;s father had taken her out of the
wilderness, or more likely up-stream to find a place
with these campers, he had come here to seek her.
To find her here, as he of course did, only convinced
him that his suspicions were true and that her father
had thus meant to rob him.</p>

<p>Two determined impulses now followed this discovery:
first, to make the girl he had bought a
prisoner, carry her into the woods, and then, when
the chance came, revenge himself on McGuire. No
sense of law, or decency even, entered his calculation.
He was beyond such scruples, and what he
wanted was his only law.</p>

<p>The fear of rifles, which he knew were plenty
enough at this camp, was the only factor to be considered.
For days he watched the camp from across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the lake, hoping that the girl he saw canoeing with
a boy so often might come near enough for him
to make a capture. Many times, when darkness
served, he paddled close to where the cabin stood,
and once landed and watched it for hours.</p>

<p>Growing bolder, as the days wore on, he hid his
canoe below the outlet of the lake and taking advantage
of this outcropping slate ledge with its many
fissures, secreted himself and watched.</p>

<p>But some shelter, at least to cook and eat in, he
must have, and this he found in a distant crevasse
of this same ledge, and from this he sneaked along
back of it until he could hide and watch the camp
below. From this vantage-point, he saw that the
girl no longer went out upon the lake, but remained
near the cabin; then later, he noticed the two men
leave the lake one morning. This encouraged him,
and now he grew still bolder, even descending the
ridge and watching those remaining at the cabin,
from a dense thicket.</p>

<p>From this new post he saw that but one man seemed
on guard, and almost was he tempted to shoot him
from ambush and make a dash to capture his victim.
Cautious and cunning, he still waited a chance
involving less risk.</p>

<p>And now he saw that certain duties were performed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
by these people; that one man and the boy always
started the morning fire; that the girl invariably
went to the landing alone for water, at about the
same time. Here for the moment she was out of
sight from either cabin, and now in this act of hers,
he saw his opportunity to land from his canoe near
this spot before daylight, and hide in the bushes
fringing the shore here and below the bank, watch
his chance and seize and gag her before an outcry
could be made. To tie her hands and feet and to
push the other canoe out into the lake, thus avoiding
pursuit until they could get a good start, was an
easy matter.</p>

<p>It was risky, of course. She might hear or see
him in time to give one scream. The old man who
had said foolish things to him, and now seemed to
be on guard, would surely send bullets after him as
he sped away; but once out of the lake, he would be
safe. It was a dangerous act; yet the other two
men might return any day, and with this in prospect,
this wily half-breed now resolved to act.</p>

<p>Old Cy was up early that fatal morning. Somehow
a sense of impending danger haunted him, and
calling Ray, he unlocked the cabin door and began
starting the morning fire. He wanted to get breakfast
out of the way as speedily as possible, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
visit this ridge, feeling almost sure that he would
find where this half-breed had been watching
them.</p>

<p>When Ray came out, and before the hermit or
Chip appeared, Old Cy hurried over to the ice-house,
and now Chip came forth as usual, and without a
word to any one, she took the two pails and started
for the landing. It was, perhaps, ten rods to this,
down a narrow path winding through the scrub
spruce. The morning was fair, the lake without a
ripple.</p>

<p>Above the ridge, and peeping through its topping
of stunted fir, came the first glance of the sun, and
Chip was happy.</p>

<p>Old Tomah, her one and only friend for many
years, was here. A something Ray had whispered
the night before, now returned like a sweet note of
music vibrating in her heart, and as if to add their
cheer, the birds were piping all about.</p>

<p>For weeks the cheerful words of one of Ray&#8217;s
songs had haunted her with its catchy rhythm:&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Dar was an old nigger and his name was Uncle Ned,</p>
<p>He died long &#8217;go, long &#8217;go.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>They now rose to her lips, as she neared the lake.
Here she halted, filled a pail, and set it on the
log landing.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/illus-123.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
Nearer and nearer that unconscious girl it crept!
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>From behind a low spruce one evil, sinister eye
watched her.</p>

<p>And now Chip, still humming this ditty, glanced
up at the rising sun and out over the lake.</p>

<p>A crouching form with hideous face now emerged
from behind the bush; step by step, this human
panther advanced. A slow, cautious, catlike movement,
without sound, as each moccasined foot
touched the sand. Nearer and nearer that unconscious
girl it crept! Now twenty feet away, now
ten, now five!</p>

<p>And now came a swift rush, two fierce hands enclosed
the girl&#8217;s face and drew her backward on to
the sand.</p>

<p>Ray and the hermit were beside the fire, and the
Indian just emerging from the hut where he had
slept, when Old Cy returned from the ice-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Chip?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone after water,&#8221; answered Ray. And the
two glanced down the path.</p>

<p>One, two, five minutes elapsed, and then a sudden
suspicion of something wrong came to Old Cy, and,
followed by Ray, he hurried to the landing.</p>

<p>One pail of water stood on the float, both their
canoes were adrift on the lake, and as Old Cy looked
out, there, heading for the outlet, was a canoe!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>One swift glance and, &#8220;My God, he&#8217;s got Chip!&#8221;
told the story, and with face fierce in anger, he
darted back, grasped his rifle, and returned.</p>

<p>The canoe, its paddler bending low as he forced
it into almost leaps, was scarce two lengths from the
outlet.</p>

<p>Old Cy raised his rifle, then lowered it.</p>

<p>Chip was in that canoe!</p>

<p>His avenging shot was stayed.</p>

<p>And now Old Tomah leaped down the path, rifle
in hand.</p>

<p>One look at the vanishing canoe, and his own,
floating out upon the lake, told him the tale, and
without a word he turned and, plunging into the
undergrowth, leaping like a deer over rock and
chasm, vanished at the top of the ridge.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The man that won&#8217;t bear watchin&#8217; needs it.&#8221;
&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>While</span> Chip, bound, gagged, and helpless in the
half-breed&#8217;s canoe, was just entering the alder-choked
outlet of this lake, twenty miles below and
close to where the stream entered another lake, four
men were launching their canoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was here,&#8221; Martin was saying to Hersey,
&#8220;one moonlight night a year ago, that a friend of
mine and myself saw a spectral man astride a log,
just entering that bed of reeds, as I told you. Who
or what it was, we could not guess; but as that
spook canoeman went up this stream, we followed
and discovered our hermit&#8217;s home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Night-time and moonshine play queer pranks
with our imagination,&#8221; Hersey responded. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not a whit superstitious, and yet I&#8217;ve many a time
seen what I thought to be a hunter creeping along
the lake shore at night, and I once came near plugging
a fat man in a shadowy glen. I was up on a
cliff watching down into it, the day was cloudy, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
&#8217;way below I saw what I was sure was a bear crawling
along the bank of the stream. I had my rifle
raised and was only waiting for a better sight, when
up rose the bear and I saw a human face. For a
moment it made me faint, and since then I make
doubly sure before shooting at any object in the
woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now these four men, Levi wielding the stern
paddle of Martin&#8217;s canoe, and Hersey&#8217;s deputy that
of his, entered the broad, winding stream. The
tall spruce-tops meeting darkened its currentless
course, long filaments of white moss depended from
every limb, and as they twisted and turned up this
sombre highway, the air grew stifling. Not a breeze,
not a sound, disturbed the solemn silence, and except
for the swish of paddles and faint thud as they
touched gunwales, the fall of a leaf might have been
heard. So dense was this dark, silent forest, and
so forbidding its effect, that for an hour no one scarce
spoke, and even when the two canoes finally drew
together, converse came in whispers. Another
hour of steady progress, and then the banks began
to outline themselves ahead, the trees opened more,
a sign of current was met, and the sun lit up their
pathway.</p>

<p>By now the spectral beard had vanished from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
trees, white clouds were reflected from the still
waters, and the gleam of sandy bottom was seen
below. The birds, inspired perhaps by the absence
of gloom, also added their cheering notes,
Nature was smiling once more, and not a hint or
even intuition of the fast-nearing tragedy met those
men.</p>

<p>And then, as a broad, eddying bend in the stream
held their canoes, by tacit consent a halt was made.</p>

<p>Martin, his paddle crossed on the thwarts in front,
dipped a cup of the cool, sweet water and drank.
Levi wiped the sweat from his face, and Hersey also
quenched his thirst. The day was hot. They had
paddled ten miles. There was no hurry, and as
pipes were drawn forth and filled, conversation
began. But just at this moment Levi&#8217;s ears, ever
alert, caught the faint sound of a paddle striking a
canoe gunwale. Not as usual, in an intermittent
fashion, as would be the case with a skilled canoeist,
but a steady, rhythmic thud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist,&#8221; he said, and silence fell upon the group.</p>

<p>In the wilderness all sounds are noticed and noted,
by night especially, because then they may mean a
bear crawling softly through the undergrowth, or a
wildcat, yellow-eyed and vicious, creeping near. But
by day as well they are always heeded, and the crackle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
of a twig, or the sound of a deer&#8217;s foot striking a
stone, or any slight noise, becomes of keen interest.</p>

<p>And now, from far ahead, came the steady tap,
tap, tap. It soon increased, and then it assured
those waiting, listening men that some canoe was
being urged down-stream.</p>

<p>Without a word they glanced at one another, and
then, as if an intuition came to both at the same
time, Martin and Hersey reached for their rifles.</p>

<p>On and on came the steady thump, thump.</p>

<p>Just ahead the stream narrowed and curved out
of sight. A few foam flecks from an unseen rill
above floated down. The white sandy bottom
showed in the clear water.</p>

<p>And then, as those stern-faced, watching, listening
men, rifles in hand, almost side by side, waited
there, out from behind this bend shot a canoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, it&#8217;s Pete Bolduc! Look out!&#8221; almost
yelled Levi, and &#8220;Halt! Surrender!&#8221; from
Hersey, as two rifles were levelled at the oncomer.
Then one instant&#8217;s sight of a red and scarred face,
a quick reach for a rifle, a splash of water, an overturned
canoe, and with a curse the astonished half-breed
dived into the undergrowth.</p>

<p>Two rifles spoke almost at the same instant from
the waiting canoes, one answered from out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
thicket. A thrashing, struggling something in the
filled canoe next caught all eyes, and Levi, leaping
into the waist-deep stream, grasped and lifted a
dripping form.</p>

<p>It was Chip!</p>

<p>A brief yet bloodless tragedy, all over in less
time than the telling; yet a lifetime of horror had
been endured by that waif, for as Levi bore her to
the bank, cut the thongs that bound her, and freed
her mouth from a pad of deerskin, she grasped his
hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>And then came another surprise; for down a
sloping, thick-grown hillside, something was heard
thrashing, and soon Old Tomah, his clothing in
shreds, his face bleeding, appeared to view.</p>

<p>Calculating to a nicety where he could best intercept
and head off the escaping half-breed, he had
crossed four miles of pathless undergrowth in less
than an hour, and reached the stream at the nearest
point after it left the lake.</p>

<p>How Chip, still sobbing from the awful agony
of mind, and dripping water as well, greeted Old
Tomah; how Hersey, chagrined at the escape of
the half-breed, gave vent to muttered curses; how
Martin joined them in thought; and how they all
gathered around Chip and listened to her tale of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
horror, are but minor features of the episode, and
not worth the telling.</p>

<p>When all was said and done, Old Tomah, grim
and silent as ever, although he had done what no
white man could do or would try to do, washed his
bloody face in the stream, drank his fill of the cool
water, and lifting Pete&#8217;s half-filled canoe as easily as
if it were a shingle, tipped it, turned the water out,
and set it on the sloping bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me take you back and watch you now,&#8221; he said
to Chip. &#8220;You no get caught again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus convoyed, poor Chip, willing to clasp
and caress the feet or legs of any or all of those men,
and more grateful than any dog ever was for a caress,
was escorted back to the lake.</p>

<p>All those waiting at the cabin were at the landing
when the rescuers arrived. Angie, her eyes brimming,
first embraced and then kissed the girl. Ray
would have felt it a proud privilege to have carried
her to the cabin, and Old Cy&#8217;s wrinkled face showed
more joy than ever gladdened it in all his life before.</p>

<p>Somehow this hapless waif had grown dearer to
them all than she or they understood.</p>

<p>There was also feasting and rejoicing that night
at Martin&#8217;s wildwood home, and mingled with it all
an oft-repeated tale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>Old Cy told one end of it in his droll way, Martin
related the other, and Chip filled up the interim.
Levi had his say, and Hersey supplied more or less&#8211;mostly more&#8211;of this half-breed&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>Old Tomah, however, said nothing. To him,
who lived in the past of a bygone race which looked
upon lumbermen as devastating vandals ever eating
into its kingdom, and whose thoughts were upon the
happy hunting-grounds soon to be entered, this
half-breed&#8217;s lust and cunning were as the fall of the
leaf. Were it needful he would, as he had, plunge
through bramble and brier and leap over rock and
chasm to rescue his big pappoose, but now that she
was safe again, he lapsed into his stoical reserve
once more. Shadowy forms and the mysticism of
the wilderness were more to his taste than all the
pathos of human life; and while his eyes kindled
at Chip&#8217;s smile, his thoughts were following some
storm or tempest sweeping over a vast wilderness,
or the rush and roar of the great white spectre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chip is good girl,&#8221; he said to Angie the next
morning, &#8220;and white lady love her. Tomah&#8217;s
heart is like squaw heart, too; but he go away and
forget. White lady must not forget,&#8221; and with
that mixture of tenderness and stoicism he strode
away, and the last seen of him was when he entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
the outlet without once looking back at the cabin
where his &#8220;big pappoose&#8221; was kept.</p>

<p>More serious, however, were the facts Martin
and Hersey now had to consider, and a council of
war, as it were, was now held with Levi, Old Cy, and
the deputy as advisers.</p>

<p>What the half-breed would now do, and in what
way they could now capture him were, of course,
discussed, and as usual in such cases, it was of no
avail, because they were dealing with absolutely
unknown quantities. The facts were these: Bolduc,
a cunning criminal, fearless of all law, had set his
heart upon the possession of this girl. Her story,
unquestionably true, that he had paid a large sum
for this right and title, must inevitably make
him feel that he would have what was his at any
cost. His first attempt at securing her had been
thwarted. He had been shot at by minions of the
law,&#8211;an act sure to make him more vengeful,&#8211;his
canoe had been taken, and what with the loss
of the girl, money, and canoe also, one of his stamp
would surely be driven to extreme revenge.</p>

<p>He was now at large in this wilderness, knew
where the girl and his enemies were, and as Hersey
said, &#8220;He had the drop on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in standing by our guns,&#8221; that officer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
continued, after all these conclusions had been admitted.
&#8220;We are here to rid the woods of this
scoundrel. We have five good rifles and know how
to use them. The law is on our side, for he refused
to surrender, and returned our shots; and if I
catch sight of him, I shall shoot to cripple,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Cy&#8217;s advice, however, was more pacific.</p>

<p>&#8220;My notion is this feller&#8217;s a cowardly cuss,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;a sort o&#8217; human hyena. He&#8217;ll never show
himself in the open, but come prowlin&#8217; &#8217;round
nights, stealin&#8217; anything he can. He may take a
pop at some on us from a-top o&#8217; the ridge; but I
callate he&#8217;ll never venture within gunshot daytimes.
His sort is allus more skeered o&#8217; us&#8217;n we need be
o&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of Old Cy&#8217;s conclusions, however, the camp
remained in a state of siege that day and many
days following.</p>

<p>Angie and Chip seldom strayed far from the
cabin. Ray assumed the water-bringing, night
and morning. Old Cy and Levi patrolled the
premises, while Martin, Hersey, and his deputy
hunted a little for game and a good deal for
moccasined footprints or a sight or a sign of this
half-breed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>Hersey, more especially, made him his object of
pursuit. He had come here for that purpose, his
pride and reputation were at stake, and the thousand
dollars Martin had agreed to pay was a minor
factor. He and his mate passed hours in the mornings
and late in the afternoon watching from wide
apart outlooks on the ridge. They made long
jaunts up the brook valley to where the smoke sign
had been seen, they found where this half-breed
had built a fire here, and later another lair, a mile
from the cabins and in this ridge. Long detours
they made in other directions. Old Tomah&#8217;s trail
through the forest was crossed; but neither in forest
nor on lake shore were any recent footprints of
the half-breed found. Old ones were discovered in
plenty. An almost beaten trail led from his lair in
the ridge to a crevasse back of the cabins, but to one
well versed in wood tracks, it was easy to tell how
old these tracks were.</p>

<p>A freshly made trail in the forest bears unmistakable
evidence of its date, and no woodwise man ever
confounds a two or three days&#8217; old one with it. One
footprint may not determine this occult fact; but
followed to where the moss is spongy or the earth
moist, a matter of hours, even, can be decided.</p>

<p>A week of this watchfulness, with no sign of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
enemy&#8217;s return, not even to within the circuit patrolled
time and again, began to relieve suspense and
awaken curiosity. They had been so sure, especially
Martin, that he would come back for revenge,
that now it was hard to account for his not doing so.</p>

<p>&#8220;My idee is he got so skeered at them two shots,&#8221;
Old Cy asserted, &#8220;he hain&#8217;t stopped runnin&#8217; yit.&#8221;
And then the old man chuckled at the ludicrous
picture of this pernicious &#8220;varmint&#8221; scampering
through a wilderness from fright.</p>

<p>But Old Cy was wrong. It was not fear that
saved them from a prompt visitation from this
half-breed, but lack of means of defence. The one
shot remaining in his rifle at the moment of meeting
had been sent on its vengeful errand, all the rest of
his ammunition was in his canoe, and now on the
bottom of the stream. Being thus crippled for
means to act, the only course left to him was a return
to his cabin seventy-five miles away, with only a
hunting-knife to sustain life with.</p>

<p>Even to a skilled hunter and trapper like him,
this was no easy task. It meant at least a week&#8217;s
journey through almost impassable swamps and
undergrowth, with frogs, raw fish, roots, and berries
for food.</p>

<p>How that half-breed, unconscious that the mills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
of God had ground him the grist he deserved,
fought his way through this pathless wilderness;
how he ate mice and frogs to sustain his worthless
life; how he cursed McGuire as the original cause
of his wretched plight and Martin&#8217;s party as aids;
and how many times he swore he would kill every
one of them, needs no description.</p>

<p>He lived to reach his hut on the Fox Hole, and
from that moment on, this wilderness held an implacable
enemy of McGuire&#8217;s, sworn to kill him,
first of all.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The biggest fool is the man that thinks he knows it all.&#8221;
&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> two weeks the little party at Birch Camp
first watched and then began to enjoy themselves
once more. September had come, the first tint
of autumn colored every patch of hardwood, a mellow
haze softened the outline of each green-clad
hill and mountain, the sun rose red and sailed an
unclouded course each day, and gentle breezes
rippled the lake. The forest, the sky, the air and
earth, all seemed in harmonious mood, and the one
discordant note, fear of this half-breed, slowly
vanished.</p>

<p>Chip resumed her hour of study each day; a little
fishing and hunting was indulged in by Martin and
the two officers; wild ducks, partridges, deer, and
trout supplied their table; each evening all gathered
about the open fire in Martin&#8217;s new cabin, and while
the older people chatted, Ray took his banjo or
whispered with Chip.</p>

<p>These two, quite unguessed by Angie, had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
almost lovers, and as it was understood Chip was
to be taken to Greenvale, all that wonder-world, to
her, had been described by Ray many times. He
also outlined many little plans for sleigh-rides, skating
on the mill-pond, and dances which he and she
were to enjoy together.</p>

<p>His own future and livelihood were a little hazy
to him. These matters do not impress a youth of
eighteen; but of one thing he felt sure,&#8211;that Chip
with her rosy face and black eyes, always tender to
him, was to be his future companion in all pleasures.
It was love among the spruce trees, a summer idyl
made tender by the dangers interrupting it, and
hidden from all eyes except Old Cy&#8217;s, who was these
young friends&#8217; favorite.</p>

<p>How many times he had taken these two over the
ridge during the first two weeks, and picked berries
while they played at it, or crossed the lake in his
canoe to leave them on the shore while he cast for
trout, no one but himself knew, and he wasn&#8217;t
telling.</p>

<p>Even now, with these two strangers about, Old
Cy, Chip, and Ray somehow seemed to &#8220;flock by
themselves.&#8221; Old Cy took them canoeing. They
paddled up streams entering the lake. He showed
them where muskrats were house-building, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
mink had runways, and otter had sliding spots; and
to forestall a plan of his own, he enlarged upon the
fun and profit of trapping here when the time came.
If these two young doves cooed a little meantime,
he never heard it; if they held hands unduly long,
he never saw it; and if they exchanged kisses behind
his back&#8211;well, it was their own loss if they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>But these days of mingled romance and tragic
happenings, of shooting, fishing, story-telling, and
wildwood life, were nearing their end, and one evening
Martin announced that on the morrow they
would pack their belongings and, escorted by the
officers, leave the wilderness.</p>

<p>The next morning Old Cy took Ray aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a good square talk with ye, my boy,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do ye a good turn if I kin.
Now to begin, I s&#8217;pose ye know yer aunt&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
take Chip to Greenvale &#8217;n&#8217; gin her a chance at the
schoolin&#8217; she sartinly needs. Now you&#8217;re callatin&#8217;
to go &#8217;long &#8217;n&#8217; have a heap o&#8217; fun this winter. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to stay here &#8217;n&#8217; keer for Amzi. This is the situation
&#8217;bout as it is. Now you hev got yer eddication,
&#8217;n&#8217; the next move is to make yer way in the world &#8217;n&#8217;
arn suthin&#8217;, an&#8217; ez a starter, I want ye to stay here
this winter with me &#8217;n&#8217; trap. The woods round here
is jist bristlin&#8217; with spruce gum that is worth a dollar-fifty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
a pound, easy. We&#8217;ve got two months now,
&#8217;fore snow gits deep. We kin live on the top shelf
in the way o&#8217; fish &#8217;n&#8217; game. We&#8217;ll ketch a b&#8217;ar
and pickle his meat &#8217;n&#8217; smoke his hams, and when
spring comes, I&#8217;ll take ye out with mebbe five hundred
dollars&#8217; worth of furs &#8217;n&#8217; gum ez a beginnin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s also &#8217;nother side to consider. Chip
wants schoolin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; she&#8217;s got to study night &#8217;n&#8217;
day fer the next eight months. If you go back with
&#8217;em, an&#8217; go gallivantin&#8217; &#8217;round with her, ez you&#8217;re
sure to, it won&#8217;t be no help to her. I&#8217;ve given you
two all the chances fer weavin&#8217; the threads o&#8217; &#8217;fect-shun
I could this summer, an&#8217; now let&#8217;s you &#8217;n&#8217; I turn
to and make some money. I&#8217;ve asked your uncle
&#8217;n&#8217; aunt. They&#8217;re willin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; now, what do ye
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Few country boys with a love for trapping, such
as Ray had, ever had a more alluring prospect
spread before them. He knew Old Cy was right
in all his conclusions, and almost without hesitation
he agreed to the plan.</p>

<p>It was far-sighted wisdom on Old Cy&#8217;s part,
however, in not giving Ray time to reflect, else the
magnet of Chip&#8217;s eyes on the one hand, and eight
months of separation on the other, would have proved
too strong, and trap-setting and gum-gathering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
with five hundred dollars as reward, would have
failed.</p>

<p>As it was, he came near weakening at the last
moment when the canoes were packed and Angie
and Chip came to take their seats in them.</p>

<p>He and his crude, rude, yet winsome little sweetheart
had suffered a brief preliminary parting the
evening previous. A good many sweet and silly
nothings had been exchanged, also promises, and
now the boy&#8217;s heart was very sore.</p>

<p>Chip was more stoical. Her life at Tim&#8217;s Place
and contact with Old Tomah had taught her reserve,
and yet when she turned for the last possible look at
Old Cy and Ray, waving good-bye at the landing,
a mist of tears hid them.</p>

<p>Old Cy&#8217;s face was also a study. To him these
parting clouds were as the white ones hiding the sun;
yet he felt their chill. His own life shadow was
lengthening. He had now but a brief renewal of
youth in the lives of these two, and then forgetfulness,
as he knew full well, and yet he pitied them.</p>

<p>More than that, he had set his hand to guiding
the bark of their young lives into the safe harbor of
a home, and all feelings of his own subserved to that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, my boy,&#8221; he said to Ray as the
two turned away, and he noted the lad&#8217;s sad face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
&#8220;she&#8217;s gone now, an&#8217; ye&#8217;d best ferget her fer a spell.
Ye won&#8217;t, I know, &#8217;n&#8217; she won&#8217;t; but ye&#8217;d best make
believe ye do. This ain&#8217;t no spot fer love-sick spells.
We&#8217;ve got work to do, &#8217;n&#8217; money to arn; ye&#8217;ve got
the chance o&#8217; yer life now, an&#8217; me to help ye to it, so
brace up &#8217;n&#8217; look cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think o&#8217; what we got to do to git ready fer
winter &#8217;n&#8217; six foot o&#8217; snow. Think o&#8217; the traps we&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to set, an&#8217; the fun o&#8217; tendin&#8217; &#8217;em. Why, girls
ain&#8217;t in it a minnit with ketchin&#8217; mink, marten, otter,
an&#8217; now &#8217;n&#8217; then a lynx or bobcat. Then when ye
go back with a new suit &#8217;n&#8217; money in yer pocket,
ye&#8217;ll feel prouder&#8217;n a peacock, &#8217;n&#8217; Chip a-smilin&#8217; at
ye sweeter&#8217;n new maple syrup.&#8221;</p>

<p>Verily Old Cy had the wisdom of age and the cheerfulness
of morning sunshine.</p>

<p>All that day these wilderness-marooned friends
worked hard. An ample stock of birch wood must
be cut and split, a shed of poles to cover it must be
erected alongside of the cabin, the hermit&#8217;s log hut
was to be divested of its fittings, which were to be
removed to the new cabin which all were now to
occupy.</p>

<p>Realizing how vital to their existence the canoes
were, Old Cy had also planned a shelter of small
logs for them on one side of the log cabin, that could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
be locked. Here the canoes not in use must be
stored at once to guard against a night call from the
malignant half-breed. His canoe had been taken
along by Martin&#8217;s party, to be left at Tim&#8217;s Place,
for even Hersey would have scorned to appropriate
it.</p>

<p>There were dozens of other needs to prepare for
during the next two months, all of which were important.
An ample supply of deer meat must be secured,
to be pickled and smoked. All the partridges
they could shoot would be needed, and later, when
south-bound ducks halted at the lake, a few of these
would add to their larder.</p>

<p>In this connection, also, another need occurred to
Old Cy. Trout could be caught all winter in the
lake, but live bait must be had, and so a slat car to
be sunk in some swift-running stream, which would
hold them, must be constructed, also a scoop of
mosquito net to catch them. These minnows were
to be found now by the million in every brook, and
forethought was Old Cy&#8217;s watchword.</p>

<p>All these duties and details he discussed that
first day with Ray, while they worked, for a purpose.</p>

<p>But the first evening here, with its open fire, yet
empty seats, was the hardest to pass. In vain Old
Cy enlarged upon the joys of trap-setting once more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
and how and where they were to secure gum. In
vain he described how deadfalls were built and
where they must be placed, how many signs of lynx
and wildcat he had seen that summer, and how sure
they were to secure some of these valuable furs.</p>

<p>Ray&#8217;s heart was not here. Far away in some
night camp, Chip was thinking of him. He knew
each day would bear her farther away. No word
of her safe arrival could reach them now. Long
months must elapse ere he and she could meet again,
and in prospect they seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, git yer banjo, my boy,&#8221; Old Cy ejaculated
at last, seeing Ray&#8217;s face grow gloomy. &#8220;Tune
&#8217;er up, an&#8217; play us suthin&#8217; lively. None o&#8217; them
goody-goody weepin&#8217; sort o&#8217; tunes; but give us
&#8216;Money Musk&#8217; &#8217;n&#8217; a few jigs. I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; our prospects
are so cheerful, I&#8217;d like to cut a few pigeon-wings
out o&#8217; compliment.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Old Cy&#8217;s hilarity was nearly all put on. He,
too, felt the effect of the empty seats and missed
every one that had gone, and Ray&#8217;s jig tunes lacked
their spirit. He essayed a few, and then quite unconsciously
his fingers strayed to &#8220;My Old Kentucky
Home,&#8221; and Old Cy&#8217;s feelings responded.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;I jist nachly hate a person that talks as tho&#8217; he&#8217;d bin
measured fer a harp.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Chip&#8217;s</span> arrival in Greenvale produced astonishment
and gossip galore. It began when the
stage that &#8220;Uncle Joe&#8221; Barnes had driven for
twenty years started for that village. There
were other passengers besides Martin, his wife,
and Chip. The seats inside were soon filled, and
Chip, seeing a coveted chance, climbed nimbly
to a position beside the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee Whittaker,&#8221; observed one bystander to
another, as Chip&#8217;s black-stockinged legs flashed
into view, &#8220;but that gal&#8217;s nimbler&#8217;n a squirrel
&#8217;n&#8217; don&#8217;t mind showin&#8217; underpinnin&#8217;. I wished I
was drivin&#8217; that stage. I&#8217;ll bet she&#8217;s a circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Joe soon found her a live companion at
least, for he had scarce left the village ere she
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hosses are fatter&#8217;n Tim&#8217;s hosses used to
be,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do ye feed &#8217;em on hay and
taters?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>Uncle Joe gave her a sideways glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hay and taters,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;we don&#8217;t
feed hosses on taters down here. Where&#8217;d you
come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to live at Tim&#8217;s Place, up in the woods,
&#8217;n&#8217; we fed our hosses on taters, &#8217;n&#8217; they had backs
sharp &#8217;nuff to split ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Uncle Joe faced squarely around.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about hosses,&#8221; she continued glibly,
&#8220;I used to take keer on &#8217;em &#8217;n&#8217; ride one ploughin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been throwed more&#8217;n a hundred times
when we struck roots, an&#8217; ye ought to &#8217;a&#8217; heerd
Tim cuss. I used to cuss just the same, but Mrs.
Frisbie says I mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I swow,&#8221; ejaculated Uncle Joe, realizing
that he had a &#8220;case.&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s your name, &#8217;n&#8217;
whar&#8217;s Tim&#8217;s Place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Chip, Chip McGuire, only &#8217;tain&#8217;t,
it&#8217;s Vera; but they allus called me Chip, an&#8217; Tim&#8217;s
Place is ever so far up in the woods. I runned
away &#8217;cause dad sold me, an&#8217; fetched up at Mrs.
Frisbie&#8217;s camp, &#8217;n&#8217; she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to eddicate me. My
mother got killed when I was a kid, &#8217;n&#8217; my dad
killed &#8217;nother one, too; he&#8217;s a bad &#8217;un.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Joe gasped at this gory tale of double
murder, not being quite sure that the girl was sane.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t they ketched yer dad yit?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nor they won&#8217;t,&#8221; Chip rattled on, as if
such killing were a daily occurrence in the woods.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a slick &#8217;un, they say, an&#8217; now he&#8217;s got Pete&#8217;s
money, he&#8217;ll lay low.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and worse, and more of it,&#8221; Uncle Joe
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must &#8217;a&#8217; had middlin&#8217; lively times up in
the woods,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Did yer dad kill anybody
else &#8217;sides yer mother &#8217;n&#8217; this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t kill mother,&#8221; Chip returned promptly;
&#8220;he used to lick her, though, but she got killed in
a mill, &#8217;n&#8217; I wisht it &#8217;ud bin him. I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
bin an orfin then. Say,&#8221; she added, as they entered
a woods-bordered stretch of road, &#8220;did ye ever
see spites here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spites,&#8221; he responded, now more than ever
in doubt as to her sanity, &#8220;what&#8217;s them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;s just spites&#8211;things ye can&#8217;t see
much of &#8217;ceptin&#8217; it&#8217;s dark. Then they come crawlin&#8217;
round. They&#8217;s souls o&#8217; animals mostly, Old
Tomah says. I&#8217;ve seen thousands on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Joe shifted his quid, turned and eyed the
girl once more. First, a wild and wofully mixed tale
of murder, and then spookish things! Beyond question
she had wheels, and he resolved to humor her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>&#8220;Oh, yes, we see them things here now &#8217;n&#8217; then,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but it takes considerable licker to do it.
We hain&#8217;t had a murder, though, for quite a spell.
This is a sorter peaceful neck o&#8217; woods ye&#8217;re comin&#8217;
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip failed to grasp his quiet humor, and
all through that twenty-mile autumn day stage
ride she chattered on like a magpie.</p>

<p>He soon concluded she was sane enough, however,
but the most voluble talker who ever shared
his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never seen the beat o&#8217; her,&#8221; he said that night
at Phinney&#8217;s store,&#8211;the village news agency,&#8211;&#8220;she
clacked every minit from the time we started
till we fetched in, an&#8217; I never callated sich goin&#8217;s
on ez she told about cud ever happen. Thar
was murder &#8217;n&#8217; runnin&#8217; away, &#8217;n&#8217; she got ketched
&#8217;n&#8217; carried off &#8217;n&#8217; fetched back, &#8217;n&#8217; a whole lot o&#8217;
resky business. She believes in ghosts, too, sorter
Injun sperits, &#8217;n&#8217; she kin swear jist ez easy ez I kin.
It seems the Frisbies hev kinder &#8217;dopted her, &#8217;n&#8217;
I guess they&#8217;ll hev their hands full. She&#8217;s a bright
&#8217;un, though, but sich a talker!&#8221;</p>

<p>At Aunt Comfort&#8217;s spacious, old-fashioned
home, where Chip was now installed, she soon
began to create the same impression. This had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
been Angie&#8217;s former home, and her Aunt Comfort
Day had been her foster-mother.</p>

<p>This family, in addition to the new arrival, consisted
of Aunt Comfort, rotund and warm-hearted;
Hannah Pettibone, a well-along spinster of angular
form and temper, thin to an almost painful
degree, with a well-defined mustache; and a
general helper on the farm, and a chore boy about
Chip&#8217;s age named Nezer, completed the list.</p>

<p>Once included in this somewhat diverse group,
Chip became an immediate bone of contention.</p>

<p>Aunt Comfort, of course, opened her heart to
her at once; but Hannah closed hers, almost from
the first day, and in addition she began to nurse
malice as well. There was some reason for this,
mainly due to Chip&#8217;s startling freshness of speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought ye must be a man wearin&#8217; wimmin&#8217;s
clothes, the first time I see ye,&#8221; she said to Hannah
the next day after her arrival, and without meaning
offence. &#8220;It was all on account o&#8217; yer little
whiskers, I guess. I never see a woman with &#8217;em
afore. Why don&#8217;t ye shave?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was enough; for if there was any one thing
more mortifying than all else to Hannah, it was
her facial blemish, and a mention of it she considered
an intentional insult.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>From this moment onward she hated Chip.</p>

<p>Nezer, however, took to her as a duck to water,
and her story, which he soon heard, became a real
dime novel to him, and not content with one telling,
he insisted on repetition. This was also unfortunate
for&#8211;blessed with a vivid imagination and
sure to enlarge upon all facts&#8211;he soon spread
the story with many blood-curdling additions.</p>

<p>These stories, with Uncle Joe&#8217;s corroboration,
resulted in a direful tale believed by all. Neighbors
flocked in to see this heroine of many escapades,
villagers halted in front of Aunt Comfort&#8217;s
to catch a sight of this marvel, and so the wonder
spread.</p>

<p>Angie was, of course, to blame. More impressed
with the seriousness of the task she had undertaken
than the need of caution, she had failed to
tell Chip she must not talk about herself, and so
a wofully distorted history became current gossip.</p>

<p>When Sunday came, the village church was
packed, and Parson Jones marvelled much at the
unexpected increase of religious interest. He had
heard of this new arrival, but when the Frisbie
family with Chip, in suitable clothing, entered
their pew, the cynosure of all eyes, this unusual
attendance was accounted for.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>And what a staring-at Chip received!</p>

<p>On the church steps a group of both young and
old men had awaited her arrival and gazed at her
in open-eyed astonishment. All through service
she was watched, and not content with this, a dozen
or so, men and women, formed a double line outside,
awaiting the Frisbies&#8217; exit.</p>

<p>Angie also failed to understand the principal
cause of this interest. Her last appearance at
this church had been as a bride. Naturally that
fact would produce some staring, and so the curious
and almost rude scrutiny the family received, was
less noticed by her.</p>

<p>But Chip&#8217;s eyes were observant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like goin&#8217; to meetin&#8217;,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217;
bein&#8217; stared at like I was a wildcat. I seen &#8217;em
grinnin&#8217;, too, some on &#8217;em, when we went in,
an&#8217; one feller winked to another. What ailed
&#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her vexations, however, had only just begun,
for Angie had seen and made arrangements with
Miss Phinney, one of the village school-teachers,
and the next morning Chip was sent to school.
And now real trouble commenced.</p>

<p>Not knowing more than how to read and spell
short words, and unable to write, she, a fairly well-developed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
young lady, presented a problem which
was hard for a teacher to solve. To put her in
the class where she belonged was absurd. She
must sit with older girls, or look ridiculous. If
she recited with the eight-year-old children, the
result would be the same, and so a species of private
tuition with recitations at noon or after school
became the only possible course and the one her
teacher adopted.</p>

<p>This also carried its vexations, for Chip was as
tall as Miss Phinney and a little larger. Not one
of that band of pupils was over twelve. To join
in their games was no sport for Chip, while they,
having heard about her thrilling experiences, with
a hint that she wasn&#8217;t quite right in her head, felt
afraid of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel so sorry for her,&#8221; Miss Phinney explained
to Angie, a week later, &#8220;and yet, I don&#8217;t know
what to do. She is so big the children won&#8217;t play
with her, or she with them. I am the only one
with whom she will talk, and she seems so humble
and so grateful for every word. I can&#8217;t be as stern
with her or govern her as I should, on account of
her temper and size.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only yesterday I heard screaming at recess,
and going out, I found that Chip had one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
girls by the hair and was cuffing her. It transpired
that this girl had called her an Indian and asked
if she had ever scalped anybody. I can&#8217;t punish
such a pupil, and I can&#8217;t help loving her, so you
see she is a sore trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>She also became a trial to Angie in countless
ways.</p>

<p>Of a deep religious conviction, and believing
this waif needed to be brought into the fold, Angie
set about that task at once. But Chip was impervious
to such instruction. By no argument or persuasion
could Angie force her protégée to renounce
her belief in the heathenism of Old Tomah, or
convince her that God and the angels were any
different from his collection of spirit forms, or
that heaven was anything more than another
name for his happy hunting-grounds. Old Tomah
had been her wise and only friend, so far. She had
seen all the ghostly forms he had described, had
felt all the occult influences which he said existed,
and neither coaxing nor derision served to make her
disown them.</p>

<p>Of course, Angie took her to church regularly.
She sat through services and bowed as all did.
Sabbath-school instruction would have been forced
upon her but for the reason that made her a class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
of one under Miss Phinney, and Parson Jones&#8217;s
attention was finally enlisted.</p>

<p>He spent an hour in pointing out her heathenish
sins, assured her that Old Tomah was a wicked
reprobate and an ignorant savage combined, that
all influences so far surrounding her had been
the worst possible,&#8211;a self-evident fact,&#8211;and
unless she confessed a change of heart, and soon,
too, all her friends here would desert her and the
devil would overtake her by and by, and then
closed this well-intended effort with a prayer.</p>

<p>Chip sat through it all, mute and cowering.
The parson&#8217;s white hair, sharp eyes, and solemn
voice awed her, and when he had departed, she
began to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the need o&#8217; makin&#8217; me say I don&#8217;t
believe suthin&#8217; when I do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
spites &#8217;n&#8217; I know I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em, an&#8217; nobody can
make me believe Old Tomah a bad man, if he is
an Injun. He runned after me when I got ketched,
&#8217;n&#8217; near got his eyes scratched out&#8221;&#8211;a logic it
was useless to contend with.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jest a little spunky devil,&#8221; Hannah
said to her later on with a vicious accent, &#8220;an&#8217; if
I was Mrs. Frisbie I&#8217;d larrup ye till ye confessed
penitence, I would. The idee o&#8217; you settin&#8217; thar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
a-mullin&#8217; all the time the minister was tryin&#8217; to
save ye! It&#8217;s scand&#8217;lus!&#8221;</p>

<p>And that night Chip was back in the wilderness
with Old Cy and Ray in thought, and so homesick
for them that she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;While yer argufyin&#8217; with a fool, jes&#8217; figger thar&#8217;s two on
&#8217;em.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> streams and swamps contiguous to this lake
were well adapted for the habitat of mink, muskrat,
otter, fisher, and those large fur-bearing animals,
the lynx and lucivee, and here a brief description of
where such animals exist, and how they are caught,
may be of interest.</p>

<p>The habits of the muskrat, the least cunning of
these, are so well known that they merit only a few
words. They are amphibious animals, their food
is succulent roots, bulbs, and bark, and they frequent
small, marshy ponds, sluggish streams, and swamps.
In summer they conceal themselves by burrowing
into soft banks; in winter they erect houses of sedge-grass,
roots, and mud, and are caught in small steel
traps set in shallow water at the entrance of their
paths out of lake or stream.</p>

<p>Mink, marten, otter, and fisher are much alike in
shape and habit. All belong to the same family, but
vary in size, also slightly in the matter of food.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
Mink and marten live on fish, frogs, birds, mice, etc.;
otter on fish and roots; and fishers, as their name
implies, subsist largely on fish. All these are more
valuable fur-bearing animals than muskrats. Their
abiding places are swamps and shallow streams, in
the banks of which they burrow, and they are usually
caught in steel traps baited with fish or meat.</p>

<p>The lucivee, or lynx, and bobcat, more ferocious
and cunning than their smaller cousins, roam the
woods and swamps, live on smaller animals, hide in
caves, crevices, and hollow trees, and they as well as
otter occasionally are caught in deadfalls.</p>

<p>Old Cy, familiar as he was with the homes, habits,
and the manner of catching these cunning animals,
soon began his trap-setting campaign. A few dozen
steel traps were first set along the stream and lagoons
entering the lake, and then he and Ray pushed up
Beaver Brook, and leaving their canoe, followed its
narrow valley in search of suitable spots to set the
more elaborated deadfalls, which also merit description.</p>

<p>A deadfall is made by placing one end of a suitably
sized log&#8211;one perhaps fifteen feet long and a foot
in diameter&#8211;on a figure four trap, so adjusted that
its spindle end, to which the bait is secured, shall
be poised beneath the upraised end of the log.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
Alongside of this log a double row of stakes is
driven to form a pen with entrance leading to the
bait. When this deadly contrivance is properly
adjusted, the log and its pen of stakes is concealed
with green boughs piled lightly over it, and all the
hungry lynx sees is a narrow opening under green
boughs, and in it a tempting morsel awaiting him.
As those creatures, as well as now and then an otter,
are sure to roam up and down all small streams,
a spot where one emerges from a narrow defile,
or joins a larger one, is usually selected for a
deadfall.</p>

<p>It is also quite a task to clear a suitable space, fell
a right-sized tree, and construct one of these penlike
traps; and although Old Cy and Ray started early,
it was mid-afternoon that day ere they had the third
one ready and awaiting its possible victim.</p>

<p>As gum-gathering was also a part of their season&#8217;s
plan, they now left the swamp valley, and, ascending
the spruce-clad upland, began this work, which is
also worthy of description.</p>

<p>The chewing gum of commerce, so delightful to
schoolgirls and small boys, is the refined, diluted,
and sweetened product of gum nuts, or the small
excrescences of spruce sap that exudes and hardens
around knot-holes and cracks in the bark of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
trees. These form into hardened nuts or knobs of
gum, from the size of a hazelnut to that of butternut,
and are worth from a dollar to a dollar and fifty
cents a pound. A long pole with a sharpened knife
or chisel fastened to its tip is used by gum seekers.
It can be gathered from the time frost first hardens
it until spring, and to gather three to five pounds is
considered a good day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Ray&#8217;s first attempt at this labor seemed like nut-gathering
at home, only more romantic, and when
they were well into the vast spruce growth bordering
one side of the Beaver Brook valley, he became so
interested in hunting for the brown knobs, loosening
them, and picking them up that he would
have soon lost all points of the compass, except for
Old Cy.</p>

<p>There is also a spice of danger seasoning this pursuit.
A wildcat might at any moment be seen
watching from the crotch of a tree, or a bear might
suddenly emerge from the thicket. It was hard
work also, for while some parts of a spruce forest
may be free from undergrowth, not all portions are,
and this tangle is one not easy to move about in.</p>

<p>There was also another element that entered into
the trapping and gum-gathering life,&#8211;the possible
return of the half-breed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;He hain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; agin us,&#8221; Old Cy asserted,
when the question came up. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t chase
him the day he stole Chip, &#8217;n&#8217; yet I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;ll show
up some day, &#8217;n&#8217; mebbe do us harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this fear that had led Old Cy to leave one
of their canoes in a log locker, securely barred, and
also to caution the hermit to remain on guard at the
cabin while he and Ray were away.</p>

<p>A canoe is the one most vital need of a wildwood
life, for the reason that the streams are the only
avenues of escape and afford the only opportunities
for travel.</p>

<p>The wilderness, of course, can be traversed, but
not easily. Swamps will be met and must be avoided,
for a wilderness swamp is practically impassable.
Streams can be forded, but lakes must be encompassed,
and even an upland forest is but a tangled
jungle of fallen trees and undergrowth.</p>

<p>Old Cy knew, or at least he felt almost sure, that
the half-breed would return in good time. He had
also reasoned out his failure to do so at once, and
knew that left canoeless, as he had been that tragic
day, his only course must be the one he actually
followed. A month had elapsed since then, with no
sign of this &#8220;varmint&#8217;s&#8221; return, and now Old Cy
was on the watch for it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>Each morning, when he traversed the lake shore
from ice-house to landing, he looked for tell-tale footprints.
He watched for them wherever he went,
and the distant report of a rifle would have been
accepted as a sure harbinger of this enemy.</p>

<p>It became their custom now each day, first to visit
all small traps in the near-by streams, then pushing
their canoe as far as possible up the Beaver Brook,
to leave it, continue up the valley, and after inspecting
their deadfalls, turn to the right out of this swale,
and begin the gathering of gum.</p>

<p>And now, one day, in carrying out this programme,
a discovery was made.</p>

<p>They had first visited the small traps near the lake,
securing a couple of mink and three muskrats, which
were left in the canoe. An otter was found in one
of the deadfalls, and taking this with them, they entered
the spruce timber and hung it on a conspicuous
limb. Then the search for gum began.</p>

<p>As usual, they worked hard. The days were
short, the best of sunlight was needful to see the
brown nuts in the sombre forest, and so they paid
no heed to aught except what was overhead. When
time to return arrived, Old Cy picked up his rifle
and led the way back to where the otter had been
left, but it had vanished. Glancing about to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
sure that he was right, he advanced to the tree, looked
down, and saw two footprints. Stooping over to
examine them better in the uncertain light, he noted
also that they were not his own, but larger, and made
by some one wearing boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tain&#8217;t the half-breed,&#8221; he muttered, with an
accent of relief, and looking about, he saw a well-defined
trail leading down the slope and thence
onward toward the swamp.</p>

<p>Some one had crossed this broad, oval, spruce-covered
upland while they were not two hundred
rods away from this tree, had stolen their otter, and
gone on into the swamp.</p>

<p>Any freshly made human footprint found in a
vast wilderness awakens curiosity; these seemed
ominous.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must &#8217;a&#8217; seen us &#8217;fore he did the otter,&#8221; Old
Cy ejaculated, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s curis he didn&#8217;t make himself
known. Neighbors ain&#8217;t over plenty, hereabout.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sun was nearing the tree-tops, the canoe
was a mile away, and after one more look around,
Old Cy started for it. There was no use in following
this trail now, for it led into the tangled swamp, and
so, skirting this until a point opposite the canoe was
reached, Old Cy and Ray then plunged into it.</p>

<p>Twilight had begun to shadow this vale ere the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
canoe was reached. And here was another surprise,
for the canoe was found turned half over, and on
its broad oval bottom was a curious outline of black
mud. The light was not good here. A fir-grown
ledge shadowed the spot; but as Old Cy stooped to
examine this mud-made emblem, it gradually took
shape, and he saw&#8211;a skull and cross bones!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, by the Great Horn Spoon!&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;I never s&#8217;posed a pirate &#8217;ud fetch in here! An&#8217;
he&#8217;s swiped our muskrats and mink,&#8221; he added, as
he looked under the canoe, &#8220;durn him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the bold bravado of it all occurred to Old
Cy. The theft was doubtless made by whosoever
had taken their otter, and not content with robbing
them, he had added insult.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;d orter be grateful he left the paddles
&#8217;n&#8217; didn&#8217;t smash the canoe,&#8221; Old Cy continued,
turning it over. &#8220;I wonder who&#8217;t can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>One hasty look around revealed the same boot-marks
in the soft earth near the stream, and then he
and Ray launched their craft and started for home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to foller them tracks to-morrer,&#8221; Old
Cy said, when they were entering the lake and a light
in the cabin just across reassured him. &#8220;It may be
a little resky, but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to find out what sorter a
neighbor we&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;When a man begins talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout himself, it seems as tho&#8217;
he&#8217;d never run down.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>All</span> fellow-sojourners in the wilderness awaken
keen interest, and the unbroken silence and solitude
of a boundless forest make a fellow human being
one we are glad to accost.</p>

<p>A party of lumbermen wielding axes causes one
to turn aside and call on them. A sportsman&#8217;s camp
seen on a lake shore or near a stream&#8217;s bank always
invites a landing to interview whoever may be there.</p>

<p>All this interest was now felt by Old Cy and Ray,
and with it an added sense of danger. No friendly
hunter or trapper would thus ignore them in the
woods. This piratically minded thief must have
seen them, for the spruce-clad oval, perhaps half a
mile in width, was comparatively free from undergrowth
where they had been working. He had
crossed it within fairly open sight of them, had found
the otter hanging from a limb, had taken it, and
thence on to rob their canoe, daub it with that hideous
emblem, world-wide in meaning, and then had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
gone on his way. Almost could Old Cy see him
watching them from behind trees, skulking along
when their backs were turned, a low, contemptible
thief.</p>

<p>Old Cy knew that bordering this oval ridge on its
farther side was a swamp, that a stream flowed
through it, and surmising that this fellow might have
come up or down this stream, he left their cabin prepared
for a two or three days&#8217; sojourn away from it,
which meant that food, blankets, and simple cooking
utensils must be taken along.</p>

<p>No halt was made to visit traps. Old Cy was
trailing bigger game now; and when the point
where they had left the canoe the day previous was
reached, the canoe was pulled out on the stream&#8217;s
bank, the rifles only taken, and the trailing began.
He followed up the brook valley a little way, to find
that only one track came down; he then circled
about the canoe, until, like a hound, he found
where the clearly defined trail left the swamp again.</p>

<p>Here in the soft carpet under the spruce trees one
could follow this trail on the run, and here also Old
Cy found where this enemy had halted beside trees
evidently while watching them, as the tracks indicated.
When the bordering swamp was reached,
the trail turned in a westerly direction, skirting thus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
for half a mile, and here, also, evidences of skulking
along were visible.</p>

<p>Another trail was now come upon, but leading
directly over the ridge, and just beyond this juncture
both the trails now joined, entered the swamp, and
ended at a lagoon opening out from the stream.
Here, also, evidences of a canoe having been hauled
up into the bog were visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sneakin&#8217; pirate come up this stream,&#8221; Old
Cy observed to Ray, as the two stood looking at these
unmistakable signs. &#8220;He left his canoe here &#8217;n&#8217;
crossed the ridge above us &#8217;n&#8217; down to whar we left
the otter &#8217;n&#8217; on to our canoe. Then he come back
the way we follered, &#8217;n&#8217; my idee is he had his eye
on us most o&#8217; the time. I callate he has been
laughin&#8217; ever since at what we&#8217;d say when we found
that mud daub on our canoe, durn him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But their canoe was now a half-mile away, and
for a little time Old Cy looked at the black, currentless
stream and considered. Then he glanced up
at the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion we&#8217;d best fetch our canoe over
here,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;an&#8217; follow this thief a spell
farther. We may come on to suthin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t he shoot at us?&#8221; returned Ray, more impressed
by this possible danger than was Old Cy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;Wal, mebbe and mebbe not,&#8221; answered the
old man. &#8220;Shootin&#8217;s a game two kin play at,
an&#8217; we&#8217;ve jist ez good a right to foller the stream ez
he has.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when their canoe had been carried over and
launched in this lagoon, Ray&#8217;s spirits rose. It was
an expedition into new waters, somewhat venturesome,
and for that reason it appealed to him.</p>

<p>Then they had two rifles, Old Cy had taught him
to shoot, he had already killed one deer and some
smaller game, and the go-west-and-kill-Indian impulse
latent in all boys was a part of Ray&#8217;s nature.
Besides, he had an unbounded faith in Old Cy&#8217;s
skill with the rifle.</p>

<p>And now began a canoe journey into and through
a vast swamp, the upland border of which could
scarce be seen. The stream they followed was black,
and so absolutely motionless that it was a guess
which way they were going. The mingled hack-matack
and alder growth along each bank was so
dense that no view ahead could be seen, and they
must merely follow the winding pathway of dark
waters and hope to come out somewhere.</p>

<p>For two hours they paddled along this serpentine
highway, and then the vastness of this morass began
to impress them. No sign of current had been met.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
All view of the spruce-grown upland they had left
was obscured by distance. Now and then a dead
tree, bleached and spectral, marked a turn in the
stream, and hundreds of them, rising all about above
the low green tangle, added a ghostly haze. It was
as if they were venturing into a new world&#8211;a
boundless morass, covered by an impenetrable tangle,
and made grewsome by the bleaching trunks
of dead trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to find which way we&#8217;re goin&#8217;,&#8221; Old
Cy exclaimed at last, as they neared a small dead
cedar that pointed out over the stream, and seizing
a projecting limb of this, he broke off bits of dry
twigs, and tossed them into the stream. For a
long moment not one stirred, and then at last a
movement backward could be discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; up-stream, anyhow,&#8221; he added,
glancing at the sun, now marking mid-afternoon;
&#8220;but we&#8217;ve got to git out o&#8217; this &#8217;fore dark, or we&#8217;ll
be in a bad fix, an&#8217; hev to sleep in the canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>No halt for dinner had yet been made. They
were both faint from need of food, and so Old Cy
reached for a small wooden pail containing their
sole supply of provisions. Neither was it a luxurious
repast which was now eaten. A couple of hard-tacks
munched by each and moistened with a cup
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
of this swamp water and a bit of dried deer meat
was all, and then Old Cy lit his pipe, dipped his
paddle handle in the stream, and once more they
pushed on. Soon a low mound of hard soil rose out
of the tangle just ahead, an oasis in this unvarying
mud swamp, and gaping at them from amid its cover
of scrub birch and cedar stood a deadfall. It faced
them as they neared this small island, and with log
upraised between a pen of stakes it much resembled
the open mouth of a huge alligator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t been built long,&#8221; Old Cy exclaimed, after
they had landed to examine it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion it&#8217;s
the doin&#8217;s of our pirate friend, an&#8217; he&#8217;s trappin&#8217;
round about this swamp. He&#8217;s had good luck
lately, anyhow, for he&#8217;s got six o&#8217; our pelts to add to
his string.&#8221;</p>

<p>From here onward signs of human presence in
this swamp became more visible. Now and then
an opening cut through the limbs of a lopped-over
spruce was met; a spot where drift had been pushed
aside to clear the stream was found at one place;
signs of a canoe having been nosed into the bog
grass were seen; and here were also the same footprints
they had followed.</p>

<p>Another bit of hard bottom was reached, and here
again was another deadfall. Tracks evidently made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
within a few days were about here, and tied to
its figure-four spindle was a freshly caught brook
sucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;The scent&#8217;s gettin&#8217; warm,&#8221; Old Cy muttered, as
he examined these signs of a trapper&#8217;s presence, and
then, mindful of the sun, he paddled on again.</p>

<p>And now an upland growth of tall spruce was seen
ahead, the banks became in evidence, and a slight
current was met. One more long bend in the stream
was followed, then came curving banks and large-bodied
spruce. They were out of the swamp.</p>

<p>Soon a more distinctive current opposed them, a
low murmur of running water came from ahead,
and then a pass between two abutting ledges was
entered. Here the stream eddied over sunken
rocks, and pushing on, the forest seemed suddenly
to vanish as they emerged from the gloom of this
short cañon, and the next moment they caught
sight of a long, narrow lakelet.</p>

<p>The sun, now almost to the tree-tops, cast a reddish
glow upon its placid surface, and so welcome a
change was it from the ghostly, forbidding swamp
just left, that Old Cy halted their canoe at once to
look out upon it. It was seemingly a mile long, but
quite a narrow lake. A bold, rocky shore rising in
ledges faced them just across, and extended along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
that side, back of these a low, green-clad mountain,
to the right, and at the end of this lanelike lake
a bolder, bare-topped cliff was outlined clear and
distinct.</p>

<p>This strip of water, for it was not much more,
seemingly filled an oblong gorge in these mountains,
only one break in them, to the left of this bare peak;
and as Old Cy urged their canoe out of the alder-choked
stream, now currentless once more, a margin
line of rushes and reeds was seen to form that shore.
Back of these, also, rose the low ledge they had
passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a good hidin&#8217; spot fer a pirate,&#8221; he
exclaimed, glancing up and down the smiling lakelet.
&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t many folks likely to tackle that
swamp&#8211;it took us &#8217;most all day to cross it. I&#8217;ll
bet no lumberman ever tried it twice, &#8217;n&#8217; if I wanted
to git absolutely &#8217;way from bein&#8217; molested, I&#8217;d locate
here. I dunno whether we&#8217;d best cross &#8217;n&#8217; make
camp &#8217;mong them ledges, or go back into the woods.
Guess we&#8217;d best go back &#8217;n&#8217; take a sneak round behind
the ledge. I noticed a loggin<a id='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a> leadin&#8217; up that
way &#8217;fore we left the swamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now something was discovered that proved
Old Cy&#8217;s wisdom, for as they, charmed somewhat by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
the spot, yet feeling it forbidding, still glanced up and
down the bold shore just across, suddenly a thin
column of smoke rose from away to the right, amid
the bare ledges.</p>

<p>First a faint haze, rising in the still air, then a
burst of white, until the fleecy pillar was plainly outlined
as it ascended and drifted backward into the
green forest.</p>

&#8220;Licker allus lets the cat out.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> the half-breed, Pete Bolduc, reached Tim&#8217;s
Place, he was more dead than alive. A week of
crawling through swamps, wading or swimming
streams, sleeping under fallen trees, while sustaining
life on frogs, raw fish, and one muskrat, had eliminated
about all desire to obtain Chip, and left a murderous
hate instead. And McGuire was its object.</p>

<p>Pete reasoned that he had bought the girl and paid
for her. Her father, never intending to keep faith,
had connived at her escape, and knowing of these
campers, had hired her for a serving maid, and they
would inevitably take her out when they left. It
was all a part of McGuire&#8217;s plot and plan, and no
doubt this stranger had also paid him for her possession.</p>

<p>Two other facts also seemed proof positive that
these conclusions were correct. First, McGuire
had never been seen at Tim&#8217;s Place since the girl&#8217;s
escape; second, it would have been impossible for
her to reach these campers without aid. But she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
was lost to him for all time, as Pete now realized.
The stern faces and ready rifles of her protectors
had convinced him of that, and all that remained
was to find McGuire, force him to give back the
money, then obtain revenge.</p>

<p>Neither was this an easy task, for McGuire was a
dangerous man, as Pete well knew, and the more he
considered the matter, sojourning at Tim&#8217;s Place
and nursing his hate meanwhile, the more he realized
that the killing of McGuire must precede the obtaining
of his money. And now, where to find McGuire
became a question.</p>

<p>Pete knew that at this season he usually devoted a
month or more to a trapping trip, that in starting
out he always ascended the Fox Hole, and that his
location for this purpose was the head waters of
another stream, reached by a carry from the Fox
Hole.</p>

<p>For a week Pete remained at Tim&#8217;s Place, and
then, obtaining a canoe, returned to his hut on this
stream.</p>

<p>And now, in the seclusion of his own domicile,
certain other facts and conclusions bearing upon the
present whereabouts of McGuire occurred to him.</p>

<p>For many years they had been friends in a way,
or at least as much so as two such scamps ever are.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
Together they had made many canoe trips to the
Provinces to obtain liquor. In these expeditions,
McGuire had furnished the means; but outlawed
as he was, had remained in hiding while Pete transacted
the business and later shared the profits.
Pete&#8217;s hut had also been used as headquarters, and
near by it the smuggled liquor had been secreted.</p>

<p>On rare occasions, also, McGuire had broken
away from his usual abstemiousness, and here, with
Pete for companion, had indulged in an orgie. At
these times he invariably boasted how cunning he
had been in eluding all hated officers of the law,
how much money he was worth, and how securely
he had it hidden. The one most pertinent fact,
the location of this hiding spot, he never betrayed.
But now Pete&#8211;almost as shrewd as he&#8211;reasoned
that it would most likely be somewhere in this region
annually visited by him.</p>

<p>To find this was a hard problem; to find McGuire&#8217;s
hiding spot for his money more so. It meant
trailing a human being of greater cunning than any
animal that roamed this wilderness; and yet with
the double incentive of robbing and revenge now
decided upon by this half-breed, he set about solving
it.</p>

<p>A day&#8217;s journey up the Fox Hole brought him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
the carry over into another stream, and here a probably
month-old trail, crossing and recrossing it, was
found. Whoever left the tell-tale footprints wore
boots, and as McGuire was the only hunter or
trapper in this region known to wear them, this
seemed evidence that it was he. Then as two trails
led over, with only one returning, that proved he
had made two trips across to carry his canoe and
belongings and had not returned. This was plain
enough, but when once over, the question of whether
he went up or down stream was another matter.
It was an even chance, however, and Pete decided
to go up, and keep sharp watch for any signs which
would indicate that he was on the right track. To
trail any animal in this wilderness was child&#8217;s play
to Pete; but to follow another trapper journeying
by canoe was not so easy. Halts for night camps
he must of course make, collections of drift in some
narrow part of the stream he would inevitably disturb,
and where a carry around a rapid came, a trail
would be left. These were the only signs possible
to discover, and for these Pete now watched.</p>

<p>The slow-running waterway he ascended the first
day wound through a stately forest of spruce. Its
banks were low and well defined, yet always covered
by undergrowth. No breaks in them, no openings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
where a night halt would naturally be made; but
ever of the same unvarying character, and shadowed
by the overhang of interlaced boughs. With one
eye keen to any even the slightest signs of human
progress up this stream, and ears ever alert, Pete
paddled on. Wildwood sights and sounds, however,
were met in plenty. Once a lordly moose, seeing
or smelling him, snorted and plunged away, crashing
through the undergrowth. Deer were seen or heard
at every turn of the stream, and dozens of muskrats
were noticed swimming or diving off the bank,
with now and then an otter or a mink, to vary this
monotony.</p>

<p>But these were of no interest to Pete. He was
trailing other game, and like an avenging Nemesis,
slowly crept through this vast, sombre, and forbidding
forest. When nightfall neared, he hauled
his canoe out where a stretch of hard bank favored,
and camped for the night, and when daylight came
again, he pushed on. For three days this watchful,
up-stream journey was continued, and then a range
of low mountains began to close in, short rapids
needing the use of a setting-pole were met, and at
last a series of stair-like falls was sighted ahead.
The sun was well down when these were reached.
How long the necessary carry might be, he could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
tell, and hauling out below the rapids, Pete took his
rifle and crept up along the bank. So far not a sign
indicating whether or not McGuire had gone up this
stream had been found, but here, if anywhere, they
must be met, and Pete watched eagerly for them.</p>

<p>Every rock where a human foot might scrape away
the moss was scanned. Each bending bough and
bush was observed, and when, perforce, he had to
leave the rock-lined bank and make a detour, he still
watched for signs.</p>

<p>At the top of this long pitch, the tall trees also
ended, and here the stream issued from a vast bush-grown
swamp devoid of timber. A few dead trees
rose from it, and climbing a low spruce, Pete saw
this whitened expanse of spectral cones extended for
miles. It was a forbidding prospect. The stream&#8217;s
course appeared visible only a few rods. It seemed
hardly probable the man he was trailing would cross
this swamp. No signs of his ascending this waterway
had so far been met, and Pete, now discouraged,
was about to return to his canoe and on the morn go
back, when, glancing across the stream, he saw a
tiny opening in the bushes, as if they had been pushed
aside.</p>

<p>To cross, leaping from rock to rock in the rapids
below, was his next move, and returning to where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
the fall began, there, just back from this point, and
beside a ledge, were the charred embers of a camp-fire.</p>

<p>Weeks old, without doubt, for rain had fallen on
them, and all about were the footprints of some one
wearing boots.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t allus the bell cow that gives the most milk.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Old Cy</span> was, above all, a peaceable man, and
while curiosity had led him to follow the trail of this
robber and to cross this vast swamp, now that he
saw the suggestive smoke sign, he hesitated about
venturing nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d best be keerful,&#8221; he whispered to
Ray, &#8220;or we may wish we had been. I callate our
pirate friend&#8217;s got a hidin&#8217; spot over thar, &#8217;n&#8217; most
likely don&#8217;t want callers. He may be only a queer
old trapper a little short o&#8217; scruples ag&#8217;in&#8217; takin&#8217;
what he finds, &#8217;n&#8217; then ag&#8217;in he may be worse&#8217;n that.
His campin&#8217; spot&#8217;s ag&#8217;in&#8217; him, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sun was now very low; a camp site must
soon be found, and scarce two minutes from the time
he saw this rising column of smoke, Old Cy dipped
his paddle and slowly drew back into the protecting
forest. Once well out of sight, the canoe was turned
and they sped back down-stream and into the swamp
once more. Here he turned aside into a lagoon they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
had passed, and at its head they pulled their canoe
out into the bog.</p>

<p>The two gathered up their belongings, and picking
their way out of the morass, reached the belt of
hard bottom skirting the ridge. They were now out
of sight from the lake, but still too near the stream to
risk a camp-fire, and so Old Cy led the way along this
belt until a more secluded niche in the ridge was
reached, and here they began camp-making. It
was a simple process. A level spot was cleared
from brush, two convenient saplings denuded of
their lower limbs, a cross pole was placed in suitable
crotches, near-by spruces were attacked with the
axe, and a bark wigwam soon resulted, and just
as the darkness began to gather, a fire was started.</p>

<p>Both Old Cy and Ray had worked with a will, and
none too soon was so much accomplished, for night
was upon them, and only by the firelight could they
see to complete the needful preparations.</p>

<p>A peculiar effect of the time, place, and their
position was also noticeable; for although at least
a mile away from where this smoke sign had warned
them, and screened from it by a high ridge, both
spoke only in whispers. More than that, the camp-fire
was kept low, barely enough to cook a modest
meal, and when the flame chanced to flare up, Old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
Cy glanced aloft into the tree-tops to see if they were
illumed. Not much was said, for Old Cy&#8217;s thoughts
were far away, and when supper was eaten he lit
his pipe and sat watching the embers while Ray
studied him. Ray, too, spoke scarcely a word. All
that day he had felt much the same, and while he had
the most implicit confidence in Old Cy&#8217;s wisdom,
now that he had advised retreat, the reasons for it
became ten times more ominous to Ray.</p>

<p>Then again, the sombre nook in which they had
camped and the vast swamp that lay between them
and the protecting cabin, all had an effect. This
weird feeling was also added to by the occasional
cry of some night prowler far away in the forest or
out in the swamp. Chip&#8217;s spites, those uncanny
creatures of the imagination, also began to gather,
and Ray fancied he could hear them crawling
cautiously about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this,&#8221; he whispered at last, &#8220;and
I wish we hadn&#8217;t come. Don&#8217;t you think we had
better go back soon as it&#8217;s daylight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe,&#8221; answered Old Cy, smiling at
Ray&#8217;s nervousness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kinder figgered we might
watch out from a-top o&#8217; the ridge when mornin&#8217;
came &#8217;n&#8217; see what we kin see. We might ketch
sight o&#8217; the pirate chap &#8217;cross the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8220;But suppose he catches sight of us,&#8221; returned
Ray, &#8220;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean he shall,&#8221; answered Old Cy, &#8220;so
don&#8217;t git skeered. I&#8217;ll take keer on ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night, however, was the longest ever passed
by Ray, for not until near morning did he fall into
a fitful slumber, and scarcely had he lost himself
before Old Cy was up and watching for the
dawn.</p>

<p>Its first faint glow was visible when Ray&#8217;s eyes
opened, and without waiting for fire or breakfast,
they started for the top of the ridge. From here a
curious sight met their eyes, for the lake and also
the ridges out of which the smoke had risen were
hidden beneath a white pall of fog. Back of them
also, and completely coating the immense swamp,
was the same sea of vapor. It soon vanished with
the rising sun, and just as the ledges across the lake
outlined themselves, once more that smoke sign
rose aloft.</p>

<p>And now the two watchers could better see whence
it came. Old Cy had expected to obtain sight of
some hut or bark shack nestling among these rocks;
but none was visible. Instead, the smoke rose out
of a jagged rock, and there was not a cabin roof
or sign of one anywhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;That feller&#8217;s in a cave,&#8221; he whispered to Ray,
&#8220;an&#8217; the smoke&#8217;s comin&#8217; out o&#8217; a crack, sure&#8217;s a gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed so, and for a half-hour the two watched
it in silent amazement.</p>

<p>Then came another surprise, for suddenly Old
Cy caught sight of a man just emerging from behind
a rock fully ten rods from the rising smoke; he
stooped, lifted a canoe into view, advanced to the
shore, slid it halfway into the water, returned to
the rock, picked up a rifle, then pushed the canoe
off, and, crossing the lake, vanished into the outlet.</p>

<p>The two watchers on the ridge exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to tend his traps, an&#8217; mebbe ourn,&#8221;
Old Cy said at last, and then led the way back to
their bark shack. Here he halted, and placing one
hand scoop-fashion over his ear, listened intently
until he caught the faint sound of a paddle touching
a canoe gunwale. First slightly, then a more distinctive
thud, and then less and less until the sound
ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;The coast&#8217;s clear,&#8221; he added, now in an exultant
whisper, &#8220;an&#8217; while the old cat&#8217;s away we&#8217;ll
take a peek at his den.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hurried gathering of their few belongings was
made, the canoe was shoved into the lagoon, and no
time was lost until the lake was crossed and they drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
alongside of where the smoke was still rising in a
thin film. No landing was possible here, for the
shore was a sheer face of upright slate, and only
where this lone trapper had launched his canoe
could they make one.</p>

<p>From here a series of outcropping slate ledges
rose one above another, and between them and
parallel to the shore, narrow, irregular passages
partially closed by broken rock. It was all of slaty
formation, jagged, serrated, and gray with moss.</p>

<p>Following one of these passages, Old Cy and Ray
came to the ledge out of which the smoke was rising
from a crevasse. It was a little lower than one in
front, perhaps forty feet in breadth, double that in
length, and of a more even surface. At each end
was a short transverse passage hardly wide enough
to walk in, and a few feet deep.</p>

<p>And now, after a more careful examination of
the crevasse out of which the thin film of smoke
rose, Old Cy began a search. Up and down each
narrow passway he peeped and peered, but nowhere
was a crack or cranny to be found in their walls.
In places they were as high as his head, sheer faces
of slate, then broken, serrated, moss-coated, or of
yellow, rusty color. Here and there a stunted
spruce had taken root in some crack, and over,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
back from the topmost ledge, this green enclosure
began and continued up the low mountain. Here,
also, in a sunny nook below this belting tangle of
scrub spruce, were ample signs of a trapper&#8217;s occupation
in the way of pelts stretched upon forked
sticks and hanging from a cord crossing this niche.
They were of the usual species found in this wilderness,&#8211;a
dozen muskrat, with a few mink and otter
skins and one lynx.</p>

<p>Another sign of human presence was also noted,
for here a log showing axe-marks, with split wood
and chips all about, was seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some o&#8217; them pelts is ourn,&#8221; Old Cy ejaculated,
glancing at the array, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve a notion we&#8217;d
best hook on to &#8217;em. Mebbe not, though,&#8221; he
added a moment later, &#8220;it might git us into more
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ray was getting more and more uneasy each
moment since they had landed there. It seemed
to him a most dangerous exploit, and while Old
Cy had hunted over this curious confusion of slate
ledges and stared at the rising film of smoke, Ray
had covertly watched the lake&#8217;s outlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better stay here much longer,&#8221;
he said at last. &#8220;We can&#8217;t tell how soon that man
may come back and catch us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Old Cy asserted tersely,
and after one more look at the inch-wide crack out
of which the smoke rose, he led the way to their
canoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s a cave thar, sure&#8217;s a gun,&#8221; he muttered,
as they skirted the bold shore once more, &#8220;an&#8217; that
smoke&#8217;s comin&#8217; out on&#8217;t. I wish I dared stay here
a little longer &#8217;n&#8217; hunt fer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Cy was right, there was a cave there beneath
the slate ledge&#8211;in fact, two caves; and in one,
safe and secure, as its owner the notorious McGuire
believed, were concealed the savings of his lifetime.</p>

<p>More than that, so near do we often come to an
important discovery and miss it, Old Cy had twice
leaned against a slab of slate closing the entrance to
this cave and access to a fortune, the heritage of
Chip McGuire.</p>

<p>Ray&#8217;s fears, while well founded, were needless,
however. McGuire&#8211;for it was this outlaw whom
they had ample reason to avoid&#8211;was many miles
away. And yet so potent was the sense of danger,
that neither Old Cy nor Ray thought of food, or
ceased paddling one moment, until they had crossed
the vast swamp and once more pulled their canoe
out at the point where they had entered it the day
before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>Here a brief halt for food and rest was taken;
then they shouldered their light craft and started for
Birch Camp.</p>

<p>In the meantime another canoe was ascending
this winding stream, and long before nightfall, Pete
Bolduc, sure that he was on the trail of McGuire,
entered the ledge-bordered lake.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;If most on us cud see ourselves as the rest see us, we&#8217;d
want to be hermits.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>To</span> trail an enemy who is never without a rifle and
the will to use it, requires courage and Indian cunning
as well. Pete Bolduc had both, and after observing
the many signs of a trapper&#8217;s presence in the swamp,
he knew, after he crossed it and reached this lake,
that somewhere on its shores, his enemy, McGuire,
had his lair.</p>

<p>He paused at the outlet, as did Old Cy, to scan
every rod of its rocky shores, not once, but a dozen
times.</p>

<p>The sun was now halfway down. A mellow
autumn haze softened the encircling mountains and
the broad, frowning peak to the right. A gentle
breeze rippled the upper end of the lake, and here,
in the wild rice growing along its borders, stood a
deer, belly-deep in the green growth.</p>

<p>No thought of the blessed harmony of lake, sky,
and forest, or the sequestered beauty of this spot,
came to the half-breed. Revenge and murder&#8211;twin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
demons of his nature&#8211;were in his heart, and
the Indian cunning that made him hide while he
watched for signs of his enemy. The bare peak
overlooking the lake soon impressed him as a vantage
point, and after a half-hour of watchful listening
he laid his rifle across the thwart, handy to grasp
on the instant, and, seizing his paddle once more,
crossed the lake to the foot of the peak.</p>

<p>To hide his canoe here, ascend this with pack and
rifle, was the next move of this human panther, and
here in a sheltering crevasse he lay and watched for
his enemy.</p>

<p>Two hours later, and just at sunset, McGuire
returned to the lake.</p>

<p>As usual, he, too, paused at the outlet to scan its
shores. He believed himself utterly secure here, and
thought no human being was likely to find this
lakelet. But for all that, he was watchful. Some
exploring lumberman or some pioneer trapper
might cross this vast swamp and find this lake
during his absence.</p>

<p>A brief scrutiny assured him that he was still safe
from human eyes, and he crossed the lake.</p>

<p>From the bare cliff a single keen and vengeful
eye watched him.</p>

<p>As usual, also, McGuire made his landing at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
convenient point, some fifty rods from his cave, and
carried his canoe up and turned it over, back of
a low-jutting ridge of slate. He skinned the half-dozen
prizes his traps had secured that day and
followed a shallow defile to his lair. Here his pelts
were stretched, a slab of slate was lifted from its
position in a deep, wide crevasse between two of these
ledges, and McGuire crawled into his den.</p>

<p>Most of these movements were observed by the
half-breed, who, watching ever while he plotted and
planned how best to catch his enemy unawares, saw
him emerge from amid the ledges again, go down
to the lake, return with a pail of water, and vanish
once more.</p>

<p>All this was a curious proceeding, for he, like Old
Cy, had expected to find McGuire occupying some
bark shelter, and even now he supposed there was
one among this confusion of bare rocks.</p>

<p>Another surprise soon came to this distant watcher,
for he now saw a thin column of smoke rise from a
ledge and continue in varying volume until hidden
by twilight.</p>

<p>And now, secure in his cave and quite unconscious
of the watcher with murderous intent who had observed
his actions, McGuire was enjoying himself.
He had built a little slate fireplace within his cave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
A funnel of the same easily fitted material carried the
smoke up to a long, inch-wide fissure in the roof. He
had a table of slate to eat from, handy by a bed
filled with moss and dry grass, also pine knots for
needed light.</p>

<p>Opening into this small cave was a lesser one,
always cool and dry, for no rain nor melting snow
could enter it, and here was McGuire&#8217;s pantry, and
here also a half-dozen tin cans, safely hidden
under a slab of slate, stuffed with gold and banknotes.</p>

<p>To still further protect this inner cave, he had fitted
a section of slate to entirely fill its entrance.</p>

<p>When the last vestige of sunset had vanished and
twinkling stars were reflected from the placid lake,
the half-breed descended from his lookout point, and,
launching his canoe, followed close to the shadowed
shore and landed just above where McGuire disembarked.
Indian that he was, he chose the hours
of night and darkness to crawl up to the bark shelter
which he expected to find, his intention being to
thrust a rifle muzzle close to his enemy&#8217;s head and
then pull the trigger.</p>

<p>But to do this required a long wait and extreme
caution. His enemy surely had a camp-fire behind a
ledge, and shelter as well. The smoke had seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
to rise out of a ledge, but certainly could not, and so&#8211;still unaware of McGuire&#8217;s position, yet sure
that he was amid these ledges, and near a shelter&#8211;Pete grasped his rifle and crept ashore.</p>

<p>It was too early to surprise his enemy&#8211;time to
fall asleep must be allowed. Yet so eager was the
half-breed to deal death to him, that he must needs
come here to wait. No chances must be taken
when he did crawl up to his victim, for a false
step or the rattle of a loose stone, or his form
outlined against the starlit sky as he crawled over
a ledge, might mean death to him instead of
McGuire. And so, crouching safely in a dark
nook above the landing, Pete waited, watched, and
listened.</p>

<p>One hour passed&#8211;it seemed two&#8211;and then the
half-breed crept stealthily up to where the smoke
had been seen. Not by strides, or even steps, but
as a panther would, lifting one foot and feeling
where it would rest and then another, and all the
while listening and advancing again.</p>

<p>It was McGuire&#8217;s habit, while staying here, to
look at the weather prospects each night, and also
to obtain a drink of cool lake water before going to
sleep.</p>

<p>Often when the evenings were not too cold, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
would sit by the lake shore for a half-hour, smoking
and watching its starlit or moon-glittering surface,
and listening to the calls of night prowlers.</p>

<p>In spite of being an outlaw, devoid of moral nature,
and one who preyed upon his fellow-man, he was not
without sentiment, and the wild grandeur of these
enclosing mountains, and the sense of security they
gave, were pleasant to him. His life had been a harsh
and brutal one. He had dealt in man&#8217;s lust and
love of liquor. He measured all humankind by
his own standard of right and wrong, and believed
that he must rob others or they would rob him. He
had followed that belief implicitly from the start,
and would so long as he lived. He felt that every
man&#8217;s hand was against him, and no reproaches of
conscience had resulted from his cold-blooded killing
of an officer. Never once did the thought return
of the few years when a woman&#8217;s hand sought his in
tenderness, nor any sense of the unspeakable horror
he had decreed for his own child.</p>

<p>So vile a wretch seemed unfit for God&#8217;s green earth;
and yet the silence of night beside this lake, and the
stars mirrored on its motionless surface, soothed and
satisfied him.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/illus-195.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
He grasped and struck at this enemy in a blind instinct of self-preservation.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>He had now and then another impulse&#8211;to
some day take his savings of many years, secreted
here, and go to some other country, assume another
name, and lead a different life.</p>

<p>And now, while an unsuspected enemy was waiting
for him to enter a sleep that should know no
waking, he left his cave and seated himself on a
shelf-like projection close to the lake, which was
deep here, and the ledge shore a sheer face rising
some ten feet above the water.</p>

<p>One hour or more this strange compound of brute
and man sat there contemplating the stars, and then
he suddenly detected a sound&#8211;only a faint one, the
mere click of one pebble striking another.</p>

<p>He arose and listened.</p>

<p>Soon another soft, crushing sound reached him.
Some animal creeping along in the passage between
the ledges, he thought.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the end of the shelf. On
that instant a crouching form rose upward and confronted
him.</p>

<p>He had one moment only, but enough to see a tall
man a step below him, the next a flash of spitting fire,
a stinging pain in one shoulder, and this human
panther leaped upon McGuire!</p>

<p>But life was sweet, even to McGuire, and as he
grasped and struck at this enemy in a blind instinct
of self-preservation as both closed in a death-grapple,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
one instant of awful agony came to him as a knife
entered his heart&#8211;a yell of mingled hate and
deadly fear, as two bodies writhed on the narrow
shelf, a plunging sound, as both struck the water
below&#8211;and then silence.</p>

<p>Death and vengeance were clasped in one eternal
embrace.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;Thar&#8217;s two things it don&#8217;t pay to worry &#8217;bout,&#8211;those ye
can help &#8217;n&#8217; and those ye can&#8217;t.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> Old Cy and Ray once more made their
way up the Beaver Brook valley, it was with the
feeling that this lone and sinister trapper might be
met at any moment. They dared not leave their
canoe where it might be easily found, but adopting
Indian tactics, Old Cy cunningly hid it in a rank
growth of swamp grass, and oft doubling on their
own tracks and wading the shallow stream, left only
a confusing trail.</p>

<p>When the deadfalls had been visited and they
began gum-gathering again, they watched constantly
for an enemy.</p>

<p>A dense forest of tall spruces is at best a weird and
ill-omened spot. Its vastness appalls, its shadows
seem spectral, and every natural object becomes
grotesque and distorted. An overturned stump
with bleaching roots appears like a hideous devilfish
with arms ready to entwine and crush. A
twisted tree trunk, prone, rotting, and coated with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
moss, looks like a huge green serpent, and even a
knot in the side of a big spruce will resemble a grinning
gnome. Even the sunlight flitting through the
dense canopy plays fantastic tricks, and every breath
of wind becomes the moan of troubled spirits.</p>

<p>Something of this weird impress now assailed Old
Cy and more especially Ray, and after two days of
unpleasant work in this part of the wilderness, they
gave it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like feelin&#8217; I&#8217;m bein&#8217; watched,&#8221; Old Cy
observed when they once more started for home,
&#8220;an&#8217; to-morrer I guess we&#8217;d best go &#8217;nother way.
Thar&#8217;s a good spruce growth over beyond the hog-back,
&#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;d feel safer leavin&#8217; the canoe whar Amzi
kin keep an eye on&#8217;t. We kin come up now once
a week &#8217;n&#8217; tend the deadfalls &#8217;n&#8217; not leave the canoe
more&#8217;n an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did Old Cy realize how groundless his fears
now were, or that fathoms deep, in a cold, mountain-hid
lake, the thieving McGuire and the implacable
half-breed were now locked in the clasp of
death.</p>

<p>A change of location, however, banished somewhat
of this spectral presence, and although Old Cy was
ever alert and watchful, he showed no sign of it.</p>

<p>Ray, more volatile and with implicit faith in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
protector, soon returned to normal condition of mind
and once more entered into the spirit of their work
and sport with a keen zest.</p>

<p>The traps gave increased returns, the little bin where
they stored their gum was filling slowly but surely, and
their life at this wildwood home became enjoyable.</p>

<p>Neither was it all labor, for the ducks now migrating
southward were alighting in the lake by thousands,
a few hours&#8217; shooting at them from ambush
made glorious sport, and what with all the partridges
they had secured and these additions, their ice-house
was soon unable to hold another bird.</p>

<p>But the halcyon days of autumn were fast passing
and signs of nearing winter were now visible. Ice
began to form in little coves, the ducks ceased
coming, soon the last of them had departed, the leaves
of all hardwood trees were now joining in a hurry-scurry
dance with every passing breeze, the days
were of a suggestive shortness, and soon the grim
and merciless snow&#8211;the White Spirit of Old Tomah&#8211;would be sweeping over the wilderness.</p>

<p>And then one night the Frost King silently touched
that rippled lake with his wand and the next morning
Old Cy and Ray looked out upon its motionless
expanse of black ice. The sky was also leaden, an
ominous stillness brooded over forest, lake, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
mountain, and midway of that day, the first snowfall
came.</p>

<p>Old Cy and Ray were a mile away from the cabin,
busy at gum-gathering, when the first flakes sifted
down through the canopied spruce tops. Soon the
carpet of needles began to whiten, and by mid-afternoon
they had to abandon work and return.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we come pretty clus to bein&#8217; prisoners
now,&#8221; Old Cy ejaculated when he shook himself
free from the white coating on the cabin porch, &#8220;but
we&#8217;ve got to make the best on&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll git warm
fust &#8217;n&#8217; then go &#8217;n&#8217; fetch our canoe up &#8217;n&#8217; stow it in
the shed. We ain&#8217;t like to want it ag&#8217;in &#8217;fore spring.
One thing is sartin,&#8221; he added, when the fire began
to blaze in the open fireplace, &#8220;we are sure o&#8217; keepin&#8217;
warm &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;nuff to eat this winter, &#8217;n&#8217; that&#8217;s all we really
need in life, anyway. The rest on&#8217;t is mostly imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of his serene philosophy, Old Cy had
dreaded the coming of winter more than Ray could
guess, and all on account of that lad. He himself
knew what a winter meant in this wilderness cabin,
while Ray did not. Separated as they were from
civilization by a full hundred miles, and from Tim&#8217;s
place by forty, they were, as he stated, practically
prisoners for the next five months.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>To escape on snow-shoes was possible, of course,
if the need arose, and yet it would be a pretty serious
venture, after all.</p>

<p>They were in no particular danger, however.
With plenty of food and fuel, they need not suffer.
If the cabin burned, they could erect another shelter
or use the old one. Something of diversion could
be obtained from ice-fishing or gum-gathering on
warm days; but not enough, as Old Cy feared, to
keep Ray content and free from the megrims.</p>

<p>None of these fears escaped Old Cy, however. He
was too wise for that; and moreover, in order to
inspire Ray, he now began to affect an almost boyish
interest in the snow coming and its enjoyments.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do much more trappin&#8217;,&#8221; he said that
first winter evening beside the fire while the snow
beat against the windows, &#8220;but we kin hev some
fun keepin&#8217; warm an&#8217; cookin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; when the snow
hardens a bit we kin go fer gum again, or set tip-ups.
We&#8217;ve got more&#8217;n a million shiners in the cage up
the brook, &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;fore it gits too cold, we&#8217;ll ketch a lot
o&#8217; trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this faculty for adaptation to the situation,
this making the best of all circumstances and seizing
all opportunities for pleasure or profit, that was
Old Cy&#8217;s woodwise characteristic. No matter if it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
stormed, he knew that the sun shone behind the
clouds. No matter if they were utterly isolated in
this wilderness, he still saw ways of enjoyment, and
even when snowbound, or shut in by zero weather,
he would still find interest in cooking, keeping warm,
or getting ready to fish, or in gathering gum, when
the chance came.</p>

<p>But winter had now come upon them with a sudden
swoop. The next day snow fell incessantly, and
when the sun shone again, a two-foot level of it hid
the lake.</p>

<p>Then, as if to test Ray&#8217;s spirits, the temperature
kept well below freezing for the next week, the wind
blew continuously, sweeping the snow into drifts,
and all the three could do, as Old Cy said, was to
&#8220;cook vittles and keep warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now for the first time, Ray began to show
homesickness. From the day Chip had left, not
once had he mentioned her or his aunt or uncle in
any way. He had kept step, as it were, with Old Cy
in all things adventurous as well as labor and sport.</p>

<p>The possible, even certain gain in the money
value of the furs and gum which they had secured,
coupled with their adventurous life, had occupied
his every thought; but now that he could only help
Old Cy indoors, he began to mope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>&#8220;I wonder what they are doing now down in
Greenvale,&#8221; he said one evening after they had
gathered about the fire. &#8220;I wish we could hear
from &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first sign of homesickness which Old Cy
had so long dreaded to see in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they ain&#8217;t havin&#8217; half the fun we are,&#8221; Old
Cy answered cheerfully. &#8220;Jest now I callate Chip&#8217;s
studyin&#8217; &#8217;longside o&#8217; Aunt Comfort&#8217;s fire; mebbe
Angie &#8217;n&#8217; Martin&#8217;s over to Dr. Sol&#8217;s, swappin&#8217; yarns.
To-morrer Chip&#8217;ll go ter school, ez usual, &#8217;n&#8217; when
Sunday comes they&#8217;ll all dress up &#8217;n&#8217; go ter meetin&#8217;.
One thing is sartin, they ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; any more comfort&#8217;n
we are, or gittin&#8217; better things to eat. If the
weather warms up, ez I callate it will in a day or two,
we&#8217;ll pull some trout out o&#8217; the lake that &#8217;ud make
all Greenvale stare. They allus bite sharp arter
a cold spell. Ez fer Chip,&#8221; he continued, eying
Ray&#8217;s sober face, &#8220;she ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to fergit ye, never
fear, an&#8217; when I take ye out o&#8217; the woods in the
spring &#8217;n&#8217; start ye fer Greenvale with five hundred
dollars in yer inside pocket, ez I callate, ye&#8217;ll feel&#8217;s
though ye owned the hull town when ye git thar,
an&#8217; Chip&#8217;ll feel ez tho&#8217; she owned ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could hear how they are once in a
while,&#8221; Ray rejoined. &#8220;They may be sick.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>That &#8220;they&#8221; meant Chip was self-evident.</p>

<p>Once a mood comes upon a person, it is hard
to change it, and of all the moods that torture
poor human beings, the love mood is the most
implacable. While the zest of trapping was upon
Ray, he was himself and a cheerful enough lad.
There had also been the spice of danger from
this unknown, thieving trapper; but when both
had vanished, and all that was left for excitement
was the monotony of indoor life, with occasional
half-days when fishing through the ice was permissible,
his spirits fell to low tide.</p>

<p>Old Cy had feared this from the outset, but
believing that the experience here was the best
possible for the boy, to say nothing of the financial
side, he had brought it about. And now he had
his hands full.</p>

<p>But he was equal to it. Next to sport, work,
he knew, was the best panacea for any mental
disorder, and work a-plenty he now found for Ray.
First, it had been the making of tip-ups for use
on the lake, then snow-shoes for both of them,
and then cutting and splitting more wood. They
had an ample supply already, piled high in a lean-to
alongside the big cabin, but Old Cy asserted
that it was not enough, and so more was added.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>The paths, one to the lake to obtain water and
one to the ice-house, were allotted to Ray to keep
open.</p>

<p>A few days were consumed in filling the ice-house
once more, and when a warm day came,
Old Cy led the way to the sheltered side of the
lake, as enthusiastic as a boy, to begin cutting
holes and setting lines for fishing.</p>

<p>This especially interested Ray, and one good day
with a fine catch of trout would revive his spirits
for some time.</p>

<p>Each and every evening, also, when the social
side came, Old Cy, always a prolific story-teller,
would engage in his favorite pastime for a purpose.</p>

<p>And what a marvellous fund he had to draw
from! All the years when he, a sailor boy, had
sailed afar, all the strange countries and people
he had visited, and all the mishaps he had met
were now levied upon.</p>

<p>When these failed&#8211;and it was not soon&#8211;his
wilderness wanderings before he settled down
at Greenvale furnished tales, and when facts
became scarce, his fancies came into play, and
many a thrilling shipwreck and hair-breadth
escape that never happened, held Ray&#8217;s attention
for a long evening.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>The banjo also helped out for many an hour.
The old hermit with his jews&#8217;-harp joined in,
and although Ray&#8217;s fingers were prone to stray
to &#8220;solemn&#8221; tunes, Old Cy persisted in his calls
for livelier songs, even to the extent of adding his
voice; and so the first few weeks of winter wore
away.</p>

<p>When Christmas neared, however, Ray had a
&#8220;spell.&#8221; It had been a calendar day in his memory,
and he had been one of the crowd of young folks
who made merry in the usual ways; but now no
cheer was possible, he believed, and once more
he began to look glum.</p>

<p>It may seem rank foolishness and doubtless
was, yet Ray, like all humanity, must be measured
by his years and judged by his surroundings.</p>

<p>In Greenvale he had been one of fifty schoolmates
whose lives and moods were akin, and
whose enjoyments must be much the same. Here
he was, in a way, utterly alone so far as age means
companionship, and worse than that, one of his
two companions was morose and misanthropic.
True, he twanged his jews&#8217;-harp in tune with
Ray&#8217;s plantation melodies, but when that bond
of feeling ceased, he lapsed into chill silence once
more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>But Old Cy, wise philosopher that he was, saw
and felt every mood and tense that came to Ray,
and, seeing thus, forestalled each and every one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas is &#8217;most here,&#8221; he said to Ray, a
few days before, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been figgerin&#8217; we three
ought to celebrate it &#8217;cordin&#8217; to the best o&#8217; our
means. We can&#8217;t do much in the way o&#8217; gifts,
but we kin bust ourselves with vittles &#8217;n&#8217; have
some fun, just the same. I&#8217;ve kinder mapped
out the day sorter this way, if it&#8217;s pleasant. Fust,
we&#8217;ll hev an arly breakfast, then pack a lot o&#8217;
things on the hand-sled, go &#8217;cross the lake &#8217;n&#8217; round
to the cove facin&#8217; the south. Here we&#8217;ll cut a
few holes, set some lines, &#8217;n&#8217; while you&#8217;re tendin&#8217;
&#8217;em, Amzi &#8217;n&#8217; me&#8217;ll clear a spot under the bank,
build a bough lean-to facin&#8217; the sun, spread blankets
in it, &#8217;n&#8217; when noon comes, cook a meal fit
fer the gods. We kin hev briled venison, fried
trout jist out o&#8217; the water, boiled taters, hot coffee,
&#8217;n&#8217; an appetite that&#8217;ll make ye lick yer fingers &#8217;n&#8217;
holler fer more. If only the sun shines, we kin
hev a heap o&#8217; fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all a boyish diversion as planned by Old
Cy, and the sole object was to tide Ray over a day
that might add to his homesickness. The weather
favored this kindly interest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>Christmas morn opened warm, and but for the
deep snow it might have been an October day.
Old Cy&#8217;s romantic plan also materialized to the
fullest, and when his green bough shed, with carpet
of the same, was completed, the fire in front
blazing cheerfully and dinner cooking, it was all
a picture well worth a study.</p>

<p>Then as if to prove that good luck trots in double
harness, about this time the trout began to bite,
and the line of tip-ups across the cove were flagging
exciting signals that kept Ray and the old
hermit on the jump. Even when their picturesque
Christmas dinner was spread upon an improvised
table in front of the bough shelter, Ray could
hardly leave the sport to eat, and Old Cy had to
interfere.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t ketchin&#8217; fish to sell,&#8221; he said to Ray,
&#8220;but jist fer fun. You&#8217;ve got more&#8217;n we kin eat
in two weeks, so give &#8217;em a rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>When dinner was over there came a lazy lounging
hour on the fir boughs in the warm sun, while
Old Cy smoked his pipe of content.</p>

<p>Ray, however, could not resist the signal flags
any longer, and as soon as the meal was eaten he
was out tending them again.</p>

<p>When the sun was halfway down, again the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
happy trio broke camp and returned to the cabin,
carrying fish enough to feed a multitude. That
evening Old Cy told stories as usual, Ray picked
his banjo and sang lively songs, and so ended
Christmas in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Our lives are but a succession of moods, varying
ever as our surroundings change; and so it
was with Ray, isolated as he was with two old
men for companions. With work or sport to
interest him, he was cheerful and content. But
when, as now happened, another long and heavy
snowfall succeeded that mellow Christmas Day,
he grew morose. It was selfish, perhaps, and
thoughtless, as youth ever is, and yet not surprising;
for when the sun shone again, they were practically
buried under snow. It took an entire day,
with all three working, to shovel paths to the lake
and ice-house, and when that was done there was
naught else except to cook and keep the fire going.
A few days of this bore heavily on Ray&#8217;s spirits,
and he became so glum that Old Cy took him to
task.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to brace up, my boy,&#8221; he said one
evening, &#8220;an&#8217; likewise count yer blessin&#8217;s. We
are shut up fer a spell, but think how much worse
off ye might be. We&#8217;ve got plenty to eat &#8217;n&#8217; keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
warm with, thar&#8217;s a good three hundred pounds
o&#8217; gum we got, an&#8217; it&#8217;s worth over four hundred
dollars, say nothin&#8217; o&#8217; the furs, &#8217;n&#8217; all yourn. Then,
&#8217;nother thing, ye mustn&#8217;t keep broodin&#8217; over yer
own lonesomeness so much. I&#8217;ll &#8217;low ye&#8217;re kind
o&#8217; anxious to see the little gal ag&#8217;in, as is nat&#8217;ral;
but s&#8217;pose it was two years ye hed to look forrard
to, a-waitin&#8217;, an&#8217; then on top o&#8217; that, arter waitin&#8217;
so long, ye hed to face three more, with never a
chance to larn whether she was dead or alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Old Cy paused, and watched the low-burning
fire as if living once more in bygone days.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a long time, these months,&#8221; he continued
at last, glancing at Ray, &#8220;an&#8217; so &#8217;tis; but I
had a longer spell on&#8217;t once, an&#8217; it ended the way
I hope your waitin&#8217; won&#8217;t. It all happened more&#8217;n
forty years ago, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ve never told nobody &#8217;bout
it since.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in Bayport, that&#8217;s a seaport town,
an&#8217; me &#8217;n&#8217; my only brother took to the sea at an
arly age. We had sweethearts, too, and, curislike,
they was sisters. Mine was Abbie Grey&#8211;sweet
Abbie Grey they used to call her, an&#8217; she well
desarved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I used to see her &#8217;tween viages, mebbe
a week or two, onct in six or twelve months o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
waitin&#8217;, an&#8217; them was spells I&#8217;ve lived over hundreds
o&#8217; times, I kin tell ye. We &#8217;greed to hitch
up finally arter I made one more viage, &#8217;n&#8217; I went
off, feelin&#8217; life ahead was all apple orchards &#8217;n&#8217;
sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, looked long at the dying embers
once more, and then continued: &#8220;Life is all a mix-up
o&#8217; hopes &#8217;n&#8217; disapp&#8217;intments, tho&#8217;, an&#8217; the brighter
the hopes the more sartin they are to be upset.
I started on that viage feelin&#8217; heaven was waitin&#8217;
fer me at shore, &#8217;n&#8217; I seemed to &#8217;a&#8217; sailed right into
the other place, fer our ship sprung a leak &#8217;n&#8217;
foundered. We took to the boats, ez I told ye
onct. Most o&#8217; my crew died afore I was picked
up, &#8217;n&#8217; then the whaler that took me aboard was
bound on a four years&#8217; viage. That was bad
enough, but worse was possible, fer she fetched
up on a coral island one night toward the last on&#8217;t,
and &#8217;twas plumb six years &#8217;fore I heard from home
&#8217;n&#8217; Abbie. Things had happened thar in that
time, too, an&#8217; I was told my brother had been
given up ez lost, &#8217;n&#8217; Abbie, believin&#8217; we both was
dead, had married &#8217;nother man. I was so upsot
I never let her know I was alive, &#8217;n&#8217; she don&#8217;t know
it to-day, if she&#8217;s still livin&#8217;, which I hope she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time now Old Cy remained silent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
his head bowed, his eyes closed, as that long-ago
page of memories returned, while Ray watched
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is a curis puzzle,&#8221; he added at last, &#8220;an&#8217;
we all live in to-morrers. Fust we are like boys
chasin&#8217; Jack-lanterns, rushin&#8217; on all the time,
&#8217;spectin&#8217; most o&#8217; the trouble is past &#8217;n&#8217; the future
is all rosy. We don&#8217;t figger much on to-day, but
callate next week, next month, next year, is goin&#8217;
to be more sunshiny, till we get old &#8217;n&#8217; gray &#8217;n&#8217;
grumpy, &#8217;n&#8217; nobody wants us &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he ceased speaking, and once more
his eyes closed. Five, ten, twenty minutes passed
while Ray watched Old Age in repose and the
fire quite died away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gittin&#8217; chilly,&#8221; Old Cy said at last, suddenly
rousing himself from his dream of the long
ago and sweet Abbie Grey, &#8220;an&#8217; we&#8217;d best turn
in.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The biggest fool thing&#8211;an&#8217; we all do it&#8211;is shakin&#8217;
hands with trouble &#8217;fore ye meet it.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> two months life at Birch Camp much
resembled that of a woodchuck or a squirrel. Now
and then a day came when the crusted snow permitted
a gum-gathering trip into the forest, or a
few midday hours at ice-fishing; and never were
the first signs of spring more welcome than to
those winter-bound prisoners. The wise counsel
and patient example of Old Cy had not been lost
upon Ray, either; and that winter&#8217;s experience
had changed him to an almost marvellous degree.
He was no longer a moody and selfish boy, thinking
only of his own privations, but more of a man,
who realized that he had duties and obligations
toward others, as well as himself.</p>

<p>With the returning sun and vanishing snow,
animal life was once more astir, and a short season
of trapping was again entered upon, and mingled
with that a few days more of gum-gathering. It
was brief and at a disadvantage, for ice still covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
the lake, and until that disappeared no use of the
canoes could be made.</p>

<p>Once well under way, however, spring returned
with speed, the brooks began to overflow, the lake
to rise, and one morning, instead of a white expanse
of watery ice, it was a blue and rippled lake once
more.</p>

<p>And now plans for Ray&#8217;s return to Greenvale were
in order, and the sole topic of discussion. He was
as eager as a boy anxious for the close of school,
and for a double reason, which is self-evident.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Old Cy and himself should
make the trip out together in two canoes, and
convey their stores of gum and firs. At the settlement
these were to be packed, to await later sale
and shipment. Old Cy would then return to camp,
and Ray would go on to Greenvale.</p>

<p>A change in this plan came in an unexpected
manner, however, for a few days before the one
set for departure, Old Cy, always on watch, saw
a canoe enter the lake, and who should appear but
Levi, Martin&#8217;s old guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been cookin&#8217; up at a lumber camp on
the Moosehorn,&#8221; he explained, after greetings
had been exchanged, &#8220;an&#8217; I thought I would make
a trip up here an&#8217; call on ye &#8217;fore I went out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>How welcome he was, and how all, even Amzi,
of those winter-bound prisoners vied with each
other in making him the guest of honor, need not
be asserted. He had been a part of their life here
the previous summer, with all its joys and dangers,
and now seemed one of them.</p>

<p>When mutual experiences and their winter&#8217;s
history had been exchanged, of course Chip&#8217;s
rescue, the half-breed&#8217;s escape, and the whereabouts
of her father came up for discussion that
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard from Tim&#8217;s Place two or three
times this winter,&#8221; said Levi, &#8220;an&#8217; neither Pete
nor old McGuire has been seen or heard on since
early last fall. Pete got thar all safe, but vowed revenge
on McGuire, as Martin and I found, when
we went out. He stayed round a week or so, I
heard later, and then started for his cabin on the
Fox Hole, &#8217;n&#8217; since then hain&#8217;t never been seen
or heard of by nobody. Tim an&#8217; Mike went over
to his cabin &#8217;long in the winter, but no signs of him
was found, or even of his bein&#8217; thar since snow
came. McGuire also seems to hev dropped out
o&#8217; business and ain&#8217;t been heard on since in the
summer. We&#8217;ve expected him all winter at the
lumber camp, but he didn&#8217;t show up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen him,&#8221; put in Old Cy, flashing a
smile at Ray, &#8220;leastwise I callated &#8217;twas him,
though I never let on to that effect. He was trappin&#8217;
over beyond a big swamp last fall, &#8217;n&#8217; he paid
us a visit, stole a half-dozen o&#8217; our catches &#8217;n&#8217; left
his trade-mark on our canoe.&#8221; And then Old
Cy told the story of their adventure, omitting,
however, any reference to the supposed cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curis what has become o&#8217; him,&#8221; Levi said,
when the tale was told, &#8220;and our camp crowd all
believe that thar&#8217;s been foul play, with Pete at the
bottom on&#8217;t. Nobody&#8217;s shed any tears, though,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; the woods is well rid o&#8217; him. He&#8217;s
been a terror to everybody long enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much more of this backwoods gossip and change
of experience filled in the evening, and next morning
Old Cy gave Ray a word of caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept whist &#8217;bout our findin&#8217; what we callated
was a cave,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; I want you to. This
matter o&#8217; McGuire and the half-breed ain&#8217;t blowed
over yit, an&#8217; we don&#8217;t want to git mixed up in it.
Ez fer the cave, if we &#8217;lowed we found one, the
folks at Tim&#8217;s Place &#8217;ud go huntin&#8217; fer it, sure, &#8217;n&#8217;
I&#8217;ve my reasons for not wantin&#8217; they should go.
So mum&#8217;s the word to Levi &#8217;bout it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Levi&#8217;s arrival, however, changed their plans,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
for he at once offered to convoy Ray out of the
woods, thus relieving Old Cy, and three days
later these two, with well-laden canoes, started on
the out-going journey.</p>

<p>It was not without incident, for when the main
stream was reached, it was dotted with floating
logs and the red-shirted drivers with the bateaux
and spike shoes were in evidence. A monster
jam was met at the first rapid, the bags of gum
nuts, bundles of firs, and canoes had to be carried
around it, and when Tim&#8217;s Place was reached,
a score of the good-natured woodsmen were in
possession.</p>

<p>Levi discreetly avoided all questions as to what
Tim knew of Chip, her father, or the half-breed.
Ray&#8217;s lips were also sealed, and so both escaped
much questioning. Here, also, they learned what
both had guessed&#8211;that McGuire and Pete had
either left the wilderness or had perished that
winter. Where and how, if such was the case,
no one seemed to know or care, and a close observer
would have said that every one at Tim&#8217;s Place
hoped that these two outlaws had met their fate.</p>

<p>Old Tomah was also found at Tim&#8217;s Place, and
he was undeniably glad to see both Ray and Levi,
and to learn that Chip was likely to be well cared for.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>When these two voyagers were ready to start,
he joined and kept with them until the settlement
was reached. Knowing full well the value of gum
and furs, he soon found a purchaser for Ray&#8217;s
store and stock at its full value; and when that
youth, now elated as never before, was ready to start
for Greenvale, this fine old Indian showed almost
a white man&#8217;s emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this to little girl,&#8221; he said, handing Ray
a package, &#8220;and tell her Old Tomah not forget.
He hope she come back to see him soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Frisbie I shall be here, waitin&#8217; to meet
him, when he sends word,&#8221; Levi said; and shaking
hands with both of his good friends, Ray now
bade them good-by with many thanks for all
they had done.</p>

<p>Of his homeward trip and all the charming
anticipations now his, no mention need be made.
They are but the flowers wisely strewn in the pathway
of youth, and Ray&#8211;now more a man than
when he entered the woods&#8211;full well deserved
all that lay before him.</p>

<p>But Old Tomah&#8217;s heart was sad, and far away
beside a rippled lake was another who felt the
same.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;When ye see two hearts tryin&#8217; to beat ez one, gin &#8217;em the
chance.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Chip&#8217;s</span> success and popularity in Greenvale
was practically nullified by Hannah, who from
wounded vanity and petty jealousy became her
enemy from the outset.</p>

<p>Aunt Comfort did not know it. Angie was not
conscious of the facts, or, busy with her own
social duties and home-making, gave them no
thought. And yet, inspired by Hannah&#8217;s malicious
tongue, Greenvale looked upon poor Chip
as one it was best to avoid.</p>

<p>With Angie as sponsor, she had been made one
of the Christmas church decorators, and had been
twice invited to parties, only to exasperate Hannah
all the more and cause an increase of sneers.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s nobody an&#8217; an upstart,&#8221; Hannah said
at the first meeting of the village sewing circle
after Chip&#8217;s advent, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve my doubts about
her father an&#8217; mother ever bein&#8217; married. Then
she&#8217;s an infiddle an&#8217; believes in Injun sperrits an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
hobgoblin things she calls spites, an&#8217; is a reg&#8217;lar
heathen. I don&#8217;t trust her a minit, an&#8217; never
leave the house &#8217;thout I lock up my things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much more of this sort fell from Hannah&#8217;s lips
whenever occasion offered, though never within
hearing of Aunt Comfort or Angie. Neither did
the townspeople enlighten them, and so the undercurrent
of innuendo and gossip, once started by
Hannah, spread until all Greenvale looked askance
at Chip.</p>

<p>There was also some color for this ill repute,
for Angie had concealed nothing, and Chip, foolishly
perhaps, had asserted her belief when it
would have been better to conceal it.</p>

<p>The parson also, chagrined at his failure to make
a convert of the girl, referred to her as &#8220;rebellious, obstinate
in her ideas, and one who needed chastening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her teacher, however, was her stanch friend.
Aunt Comfort beamed upon her morning and
night, while Angie, having provided her with
home, raiment, opportunity for schooling, escort
to church, and much good advice, felt that she
had fulfilled her duty. And in a way, she had.</p>

<p>But social recognition in a country village can
be made or marred by such a person as Hannah,
and quite unknown to those most interested,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
Chip&#8217;s popularity was not decreed. Neither was
she conscious of this undercurrent. Each day
she went to and returned from school in a sturdy
sort of way. A most devoted pupil, she never
failed to thank her teacher for every word of help,
and if&#8211;thanks to Hannah&#8211;she failed to make
friends about the village, she won a place near to
Aunt Comfort&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>But somehow Aunt Comfort, who loved everybody
alike, good or bad, or at least spoke no ill
of the bad ones, didn&#8217;t count. That she must
inevitably take Chip under her motherly wing,
all recognized. She had taken Hannah, then Angie
and Nezer, and now this waif who, as Hannah
insisted, was all bad; and according to Greenvale&#8217;s
belief, Aunt Comfort would keep on &#8220;taking in&#8221;
homeless waifs and outcast mortals as long as she
lived, or house room held out. And it was true.</p>

<p>By midwinter Martin&#8217;s new house was all furnished,
and social obligations began to interest
Angie, which made matters all the worse for Chip,
for now Hannah could persecute her with less
danger of exposure.</p>

<p>But Chip was hard to persecute. She had
known adversity in its worst form. Her life at
Tim&#8217;s Place had been practical slavery, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
worst that Hannah could do was as pin pricks
compared to it.</p>

<p>It is certain, also, if Chip had &#8220;spunked up,&#8221;
as Hannah would call it, now and then, it would
have been better for her; but it wasn&#8217;t Chip&#8217;s
way. To work and suffer in silence had been her
lot at Tim&#8217;s Place. Angie had said, &#8220;You must
obey everybody and make friends,&#8221; and impelled
by experience, and this somewhat broad order,
Chip was doing her best.</p>

<p>One hope cheered her all that long, hard winter of
monotonous study&#8211;the return of Ray, and possibly
Old Cy, when summer came. Somehow these two
had knit themselves into her life as no one else had
or could. Then she wondered how Ray would seem
to and feel toward her when he came, and if the
little bond&#8211;a wondrous strong one, as far as her
feelings went&#8211;would still call him to her side.</p>

<p>Of love and its real meaning she was scarce
conscious as yet. She simply felt that this youth
with his sunny face and brown eyes was the one
being on earth she wished to please. All the romance
and pathos of that summer idyl, all the moonlight
and canoeing, all the songs he had charmed
her with, and every word and act of his from that
first evening when, ragged and starving, she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
stumbled into the camp, until she had parted
from him with misty eyes, had been lived over by
her countless times.</p>

<p>It had all been a beacon of hope to her in the
uphill road toward the temple of learning; and
how hard she had studied, and how patiently she
had tried to correct her own speech, not even her
teacher guessed.</p>

<p>Few of us can see ourselves as others see us,
and yet Chip, mature of mind as one just entering
womanhood, realized somewhat her own condition.
Perhaps, also, she was conscious in some
degree as to why she was not more popular, but
that was a matter of scant interest to her. All
she wished and all she strove for was to learn what
others knew, speak as others spoke, and act as
they acted; and all for one end and purpose&#8211;to
win favor in the eyes of Ray.</p>

<p>And so no one, not even Hannah, whose prying
eyes saw all things, guessed her secret.</p>

<p>A little of gall and bitterness was now and then
meted out to Hannah in return for all her sneers,
for Chip&#8217;s teacher occasionally spent an evening
at Aunt Comfort&#8217;s, and every word of praise she
let fall for her pupil was a thorn to Hannah. But
she revenged herself, as might be expected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>&#8220;I think that Injun gal&#8217;s a witch,&#8221; she said
once to her bosom friend after one of these unpleasant
evenings, &#8220;the way she pulls wool over Miss
Phinney&#8217;s eyes by pretending she&#8217;s so anxious to
learn. You&#8217;d think to hear her go on that learnin&#8217;
was all she was livin&#8217; for, and her teacher almost
an angel. I think Angie must &#8217;a&#8217; ben spellbound
the same way when she fetched her here to crowd
out her betters.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip, fortunately, was still unconscious of
the extent and injury of Hannah&#8217;s malice.</p>

<p>With the coming of springtime and green grass,
life for Chip assumed a more smiling face, for now
she could fly to the hillsides, and for the time being
imagine herself at the lake once more. Somehow
Greenvale as a whole had impressed her as
cold and unloving, and to escape it was a relief.
Her teacher was dear to her, Aunt Comfort a
kindly mother, Angie a good friend; but none
were kin to her and never could be, as she more
and more realized.</p>

<p>Then, too, poor Chip, in spite of Tim&#8217;s Place, was
growing homesick for the wilderness again; or, to
be more accurate, for the little lake where her heart
had been touched by the wand of love.</p>

<p>With some insight into books and a developing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
mind came a keener sensitiveness, and what people
thought of her and how they felt toward her became
of more consequence. Her life was simple. She
rose early, assisted as a housemaid in Aunt Comfort&#8217;s
home, departed at a set time for school with its
six hours of almost unbroken study, and, most prized
of all, a few moments&#8217; companionship with her
teacher. To her Chip had confided all her joys
and sorrows and most of her history as well. And
be it said to Miss Phinney&#8217;s credit, she had discretion
and honor enough not to betray Chip&#8217;s confidence.</p>

<p>It is also possible, in fact almost certain, that
that unfortunate waif&#8217;s somewhat pitiful tale had
won her teacher&#8217;s interest and affection as naught
else could. Only one reservation was made by
Chip&#8211;her own feelings toward Ray. All else became
an open book to Miss Phinney.</p>

<p>When school was out, the two walked homeward
together as far as their ways permitted, and then
Chip obtained the one hour of the day which she
felt was quite her own. At first, during the autumn
days, she had used it for a scamper through the nutbrown
woods. When winter came and it was not
too cold, she occasionally visited the mill pond above
the village, where, if the conditions were right, all
the skating and sliding youth were gathered; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
when blessed spring returned, it was away to the
hills and fields once more.</p>

<p>On Saturdays she seldom left the house, unless
sent on an errand, and Sunday became a day of
penance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why folks watch me so much when
I go to meetin&#8217;,&#8221; Chip complained once to her teacher,
&#8220;but they do, and I don&#8217;t like it. I can see now
why they did when I first came. I guess they
thought I was an Injun, maybe; but what do I do
now to make &#8217;em so curious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t mind them,&#8221; Miss Phinney
answered soothingly, &#8220;no one intends to annoy you;
but it takes a long time for people here to become
accustomed to a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Phinney dared not tell her pupil that her
somewhat wild belief and unquestionably rude
origin and early life formed the basis of this curiosity.</p>

<p>And now, when the flowers and birds had once
more returned to Greenvale, and Ray might return
any day, a little plan that Chip had had in mind
for many weeks took shape. She knew Ray must
come on the stage, and eager for a sight of his face
as only love can make one, she meant to be the first
to meet and greet him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>A mile down the village street and beyond the
last house was a sharp hilltop. The stage usually
reached here about an hour after the close of school,
and to this vantage point, where she could hide
behind a stone wall, Chip now betook herself each
day.</p>

<p>Her plans for meeting her young hero were well
considered. She was sure he would, like herself,
prefer a seat with Uncle Joe. That important
person, whose heart she had won by her admiration
of his horses on her arrival, would surely invite her
to ride into the village, if he saw her. If he was
alone, she would remain hid; but if <i>some one</i> was with
him, she would then disclose herself and the coveted
invitation and meeting with Ray would follow.</p>

<p>It was a vague, uncertain plan. No one in Greenvale
had the remotest idea when Ray would return.
Chip only knew that he was expected in the spring.
The day, or even week, was a long-range guess.
But even that slim chance poor, lonesome, heart-longing
Chip would not miss, and so each day at
close of school she hurried to her lookout point to
watch and wait.</p>

<p>It was a silly, almost hopeless sentinelship, as she
knew well enough; but with the dog&#8217;s heart that
was hers, she would keep her vigil, and like one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
those dumb brutes, wait weeks, months, ay, years
even, for a master coming.</p>

<p>It was mid-April when Chip began her daily watch,
and missed no day unless a pelting rain prevented.
It was June ere she won her reward, and then one
balmy afternoon when she saw the stage afar, there,
perched beside Uncle Joe, was&#8211;a companion!</p>

<p>How sure that weary, waiting waif was that her
heart was not mistaken! How her pulses leaped
and thrilled as the slow-moving stage crept up the
hill; and how Ray, eager to catch the first glimpse
of his native village, saw a winsome, smiling face
shaded by a flower-decked hat, peeping at him over
a wall, was but a minor episode in the lives of these
two; yet one to be recalled many, many times afterward
and always with a heartache.</p>

<p>None came to them now, for on the instant Ray
saw who was waiting for him he halted the stage,
and the next moment he was beside his sweetheart.
And Uncle Joe, with the wisdom and sympathy of
old age, discreetly averted his face, and said &#8220;Go-lang&#8221;
to his horses, and drove on alone.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t but few folks smell woollen quite quick enough.&#8221;
&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>During</span> all the long weeks while Chip had awaited
her lover&#8217;s coming, one hope had been hers&#8211;that
his return would end all her loneliness and begin
a season of the happy, care-free days like those by
the lake once more.</p>

<p>And there were many reasons for it.</p>

<p>In this quiet, strictly religious, gossip-loving village,
a dependant upon charity, as it were, and with
Hannah&#8217;s sneers, Chip had slowly but surely learned
how little akin she was to them all, and how distrustful
they all were of her. This knowledge had come
by degrees: first, from the way in which the older
pupils at school regarded her, having always kept
aloof; then the insistent staring she received each
Sunday at church; the somewhat chilly reception
she had met in a social way; and lastly, a seeming
indifference on Angie&#8217;s part. There was no reason
for it all, so far as Chip could understand. She
walked in the straight and narrow path laid out for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
her each day, made herself useful between school
hours at Aunt Comfort&#8217;s, studied hard, thanked
Angie for every trifle, and after her first unfortunate
experience in defending her belief in spites and Old
Tomah&#8217;s hobgoblins, she had never referred to them
again. But the seeming fact that she was disliked
and unwelcome here had slowly forced itself upon
her and added to her loneliness.</p>

<p>It was all to end, however, when Ray came. In
him or from him she would find a welcome. He
knew her as she was, and what she was. He had
not been distrustful, but tender and loving, and all
clouds and sorrow and all humiliations would fade
away when he came.</p>

<p>She had pictured to herself, also, how much they
would be together and where; how he would come
to Aunt Comfort&#8217;s the first evening and tell all about
his winter in the wilderness and Old Cy,&#8211;all about
the trap-setting, gum-gathering, and the deep snows
she knew so much about. Maybe he would bring
his banjo now and then and play and sing the darky
songs she had hummed so many times. Possibly
he might come and meet her occasionally on the
way home from school; and when vacation came,
how many long rambles they would take in the dear
old woods, with no such ogre as the half-breed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
spoil them. It had all been a rosy-hued dream
with her, while she waited his coming. And now
he was here!</p>

<p>For the first few moments after he kissed her upraised
lips, she could not speak for very joy; and
then, as hand in hand they started toward the village,
her speech came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been so lonesome,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
counted the days, and come down here to meet you
daily, for over a month. I don&#8217;t like it here, and
nobody likes me, I guess. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve come,
though. Now I shan&#8217;t be lonesome no more. I&#8217;ve
studied hard, too,&#8221; she added, with an accent of
pride. &#8220;I can read and spell words of six syllables.
I&#8217;ve ciphered up to decimal fractions, an&#8217;
begun grammar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to get home, too,&#8221; answered Ray, as
simply. &#8220;It was lonesome in the woods all winter,
when we couldn&#8217;t tend the traps. But I&#8217;ve made
a lot of money&#8211;&#8217;most five hundred dollars&#8211;all
mine, too. How is everybody?&#8221; And so they
dropped from sentiment into commonplace.</p>

<p>At the tavern he secured his belongings. At the
corner where their ways parted, he bade Chip a light
good-by, and with an &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you soon,&#8221; left her.</p>

<p>Her hero had arrived. They had met, kissed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
lovers should, and the lonely waiting and watching
days were at an end and a new life was to begin for
Chip.</p>

<p>Little did she realize what it would mean for her,
or how utterly her hopes were to fail.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come to-night,&#8221; her heart assured her,
and that evening, without a word to Aunt Comfort
or Hannah as to whom she expected, she arrayed
herself in her one best dress and awaited his expected
visit.</p>

<p>And what a propitious and all-favoring evening
it was! The June night was balmy. Blooming
lilacs and syringas half hid, as well as adorned, the
porch of Aunt Comfort&#8217;s home. Aunt Comfort had
just departed to make a call, Hannah was away at
prayer meeting, and &#8220;no one nigh to hinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip waited in vain!</p>

<p>The drowsy hum of the Mizzy Falls, up the village
street, came to her; the fireflies twinkled amid
the dense-growing maples and over the broad
meadows; whippoorwills called across the valley;
but no lover came to Chip. One, two, almost
three hours she waited and watched. Then came
Aunt Comfort and Hannah, and heavy-hearted and
lonesome once more, poor Chip retired.</p>

<p>At school next day her mind and heart were at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
war. The parts of speech and rules of subtraction
and division seemed complete chaos, and when
homeward bound, she loitered slowly along, hoping
Ray would make amends and meet her on the way.
But again he failed to appear.</p>

<p>And that night, when alone with Hannah, a worse
blow came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heerd young Stetson got back yesterday,&#8221; she
said, fixing her steely blue eyes on Chip, &#8220;an&#8217; you
went down the road to meet him. I should think
you&#8217;d be &#8217;shamed o&#8217; yourself. If you&#8217;re callatin&#8217; on
settin&#8217; your cap for him, &#8217;twon&#8217;t do a mite o&#8217; good.
His aunt wouldn&#8217;t think o&#8217; havin&#8217; sich an outcast ez
you for him&#8211;that I can tell ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>But not a word of reply came from poor Chip.
Such speeches were not new to her, and she had long
before ceased to answer them. But this one, from
its very truth, hurt more than all others had, and,
crushed by it, she stole away out of the house.</p>

<p>No thought that Ray might call came to her. She
only wished to escape somewhere, that she might
cry away her misery and shame in solitude.</p>

<p>The evening was but a repetition of the previous
one. The same sweet influence and silvered light
was all about, but no heed of its beauty came to
Chip. Instead, she felt herself a shameful thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
of no account. Her lover had failed her&#8211;now she
knew why, and as she sped along the lonely way to
the schoolhouse, scarce conscious of her steps, all
hope and all joy left her. Why or for what purpose
she was hurrying toward this deserted little building,
she knew not. Hot tears filled her eyes. Shame
surged in her heart. She was a nobody in the eyes of
all her world, and once she had reached the worn
sill, so often crossed by her, she threw herself upon
it and sobbed in utter despair.</p>

<p>For a long hour she sat there while the tide of
feeling ebbed and tears came unchecked, and then
the reaction came. With it, also, came something
of the old courage and defiance that had once led
her to face night, danger, and sixty miles of wilderness
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made a mistake,&#8221; she said, sitting up,
&#8220;and Hannah was right. I am a nobody here, and
Ray has been told so and has kept away.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now with returning calm, and soothed,
maybe, by the still, ethereal night, she saw herself,
her past and present, as it all was. Back in an
instant she sped in thought to the moment when,
kneeling to these people, she begged for food; back
to that first prayer she ever heard in the tent, and
the offer of rescue that followed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>And then her life here, with all its hopes and
humiliation, rose before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all wrong, my coming here,&#8221; she said,
looking away to the village where lights twinkled;
&#8220;I am not their sort, nor they mine. I&#8217;d better go
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, lifted a wee bit by this new resolve, she
rose and returned to the house.</p>

<p>The tall clock in the sitting room was just chiming
ten when she entered, and Aunt Comfort was there
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raymond was here this evening,&#8221; she said
kindly, &#8220;and waited quite a spell. Where have you
been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nowhere,&#8221; answered Chip, pleasantly, &#8220;only
I was lonesome and went out for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did good Aunt Comfort realize what a volcano
of hope, despair, shame, and tender love was
concealed beneath that calm answer, or the new
resolve budding in Chip&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>No more did Ray suspect it when he met her
coming home from school the next afternoon.</p>

<p>For during those two wretched hours when she
was alone on the worn schoolhouse step, poor Chip
McGuire, the low-born, pitiful waif, had become a
woman and put away girlish impulses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t come to see you that first evening,&#8221;
he said at once, &#8220;for uncle and aunty kept me talking
till bedtime. Where were you last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t much think you would come,&#8221; answered
Chip, calmly, smiling at him in a far-off way.
&#8220;I am a nobody here, as you will soon find out, and
I don&#8217;t expect&#8211;anything. I got lonesome last
night and went off for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ray looked at her in wide-eyed astonishment.
And well he might, for only two short days since she
had met him, an eager, simple girl, and now she
spoke like a woman. No word, no hint of his
neglect, escaped her; but a cool indifference was
apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about the woods and Old Cy,&#8221; she said,
not waiting for him to speak again, &#8220;and how is the
hermit? I want to know all about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I left &#8217;em all right,&#8221; answered Ray, sullenly,
for like a boy he wanted to be coaxed. And then,
urged a little by Chip, he told his winter&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>One episode interested her most of all&#8211;the
strange trapper&#8217;s doings, his theft of their game,
their pursuit of him and discovery of his hiding spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know who that was,&#8221; she said, when it was all
described. &#8220;It was my father, and if he had caught
you spying upon him, I guess he&#8217;d shot you both.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
He always used to go somewhere trapping every
fall; but nobody could ever find where.&#8221;</p>

<p>This return to the memories of the wilderness
wore away something of Chip&#8217;s cool reserve, and
when the house was reached her eyes had grown
tender.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to see you often&#8211;as&#8211;as your
folks will let you come,&#8221; she said, somewhat timidly
when they parted; and scarce understanding this
speech, Ray left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chip has changed a whole lot,&#8221; he said to his aunt
a little later, &#8220;and I wish she hadn&#8217;t; she don&#8217;t seem
the same any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it if she has,&#8221; answered Angie, smiling
at him. &#8220;There was need enough of it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Old Cy</span> had builded wiser than he realized when
he coaxed Ray to spend a winter in the woods.</p>

<p>The long tramps through the vast wilderness; the
keen hunt for signs of mink, fisher, otter, and wildcat,
with constant guard against danger; the unremitting
though zestful labor of gum-gathering; the
far-sighted need for winter preparation; and last
but not least Old Cy&#8217;s cheerful philosophy, had
broadened the lad and developed both muscle and
mind.</p>

<p>His success, too, had encouraged him. He was
eager to try another season there, and planned for
hiring men to gather gum, and saw in this vocation
possible future.</p>

<p>But the change in Chip puzzled him. He had
returned, expecting to find her the same timid, yet
courageous little girl, ready to be his companion
at all times and to kiss him when he chose&#8211;a
somewhat better-educated girl, of course, using more
refined language, but otherwise the same confiding
child, as it were.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>She was all this the day of his return; and then,
presto! like a sudden blast of cold air came a
change. Too loyal to her to question any one, he
could only wonder why this change.</p>

<p>He called again soon after that first, unsatisfying
walk home with her, to find her the same cool, collected
young lady. She was nice to him, induced
him to talk of the woods once more and his own
plans; but it was not the Chip of old who listened,
but quite another person.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to the lake with uncle and aunt,&#8221;
he said at last, &#8220;and I mean to coax them to take
you along. You have been shut up in school so
long, it will do you good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say a word to them about it,&#8221; she
urged, in hurt tone, &#8220;for it will do no good. I
wouldn&#8217;t go, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not go to the woods if you could,&#8221; he exclaimed
in astonishment; &#8220;why, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; she returned firmly, and then
added wistfully, &#8220;I&#8217;d fly there, if I had wings. I&#8217;d
give my life, almost, for one more summer like the
last. But I shall not go again now, and maybe
never.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was unaccountable and quite beyond Ray&#8217;s
ken&#8211;this strange decision of hers&#8211;and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say any more about it,&#8221; closed the
subject.</p>

<p>Another and even greater shock came to Ray when
late that evening, on the porch, he essayed to kiss her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; please don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said with almost a
sob, pushing him away. &#8220;It&#8217;s silly now, and&#8211;and&#8211;you
mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>A week later school closed, and Chip&#8217;s conduct
was then also a puzzle to Miss Phinney. As usual
on these occasions, when the hour came, each pupil,
young and old, filed past the teacher at her desk,
the boys to shake hands, the girls to be kissed, and
all bade good-by, after which they trooped away,
glad to escape.</p>

<p>This ceremony now took place as usual. All
departed except Chip, and she remained at her
desk. Some intuition of pity or sympathy drew
Miss Phinney to her at once; and then, at the first
word from her, Chip gave way to tears&#8211;not light
ones, but sobs that shook her as a great grief.
Vainly Miss Phinney tried to cheer and console her,
stroking the bowed head until her own eyes grew
misty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to give way,&#8221; Chip said at last,
looking up and brushing away the tears, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve
been so good and patient with me, I couldn&#8217;t help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
it. I hain&#8217;t many friends here, I guess, and&#8211;&#8221;
choking back another sob&#8211;&#8220;I shall be more
lonesome&#8217;n ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true enough, as Miss Phinney well understood,
and somehow her heart went out to this unfortunate
girl now, as never before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think about that,&#8221; she said at last,
in her most soothing voice, &#8220;but come and see me
as often as you can&#8211;every day, if you like, for I
shall always be glad to have you. I&#8217;d keep on
studying, if I were you,&#8221; she added, as Chip brightened,
&#8220;it will help you on, and I will gladly hear
you recite every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then hand in hand, like two sisters, they left the
dear old schoolhouse. Little did Miss Phinney,
good soul that she was, realize how recently poor
Chip had cried her heart almost out on its well-worn
sill, or that never again would this strange,
winsome, woman-grown pupil enter that temple.</p>

<p>At the parting of their ways the two embraced,
kissed, and with tear-dimmed eyes separated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t account for it,&#8221; Miss Phinney said to
herself when well away. &#8220;It may be a love-affair
with young Stetson, or it may be something worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening she called on Angie. The result
was fruitless, so far as obtaining any light upon this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
puzzling matter was concerned, for Angie was
either blind to the situation, or feigned ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were together all last summer, of course,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;in fact, they were forced to be like two
children, you know. I was glad to have it so, feeling
it would benefit the girl. If any love flame was
started then, it has had ample time to die out since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something else the matter with Chip,
then,&#8221; Miss Phinney rejoined, &#8220;she has been moody
and quite upset at times for the past few weeks, and
to-day when school closed, she sobbed like a brokenhearted
woman. It was quite pathetic, and I had
to cry myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night Angie took counsel of her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if it is so,&#8221; he responded, to her suggestion
that a love-affair might have started between
them. &#8220;It won&#8217;t harm either. So far as I&#8217;ve observed,
the girl couldn&#8217;t have been better behaved
since she came here. She has never missed an hour
at school all winter, no matter how cold it has been.
Her teacher says she has made wonderful progress.
She has attended church with you every Sunday,
and as for Ray&#8211;well, if I were in his shoes, I&#8217;d
be in love with her myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear enough that Angie&#8217;s fears were not
shared by Martin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>&#8220;But think of her origin and parentage,&#8221; answered
Angie, &#8220;and that outlaw father who might
appear at any time! The very idea of Ray marrying
her is preposterous. It would wreck his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about Chip?&#8221; returned Martin, who
had broader views of life. &#8220;You brought her here
to Christianize and educate her; do you propose
to turn her adrift because she has a pretty face and
the boy sees it? She isn&#8217;t to blame for her origin.
As for Ray, if he shows that he is able to support a
wife and wants her, I honor him for it, and I&#8217;ll give
him a house to start with.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Aunt Comfort&#8217;s, however, no signs of love
troubles were visible; in fact, no signs of any sort,
except the malicious &#8220;hanging around&#8221; interference
of Hannah whenever Ray was there. She seemed
to feel it her duty to remain on guard at such times,
much to Ray&#8217;s disgust. No annoyance at this
was apparent in Chip. She helped at housework,
studied at odd hours, and when Ray came she met
and talked with him as if he were a brother.</p>

<p>The day he was to leave Greenvale was close at
hand, however, and the evening before he came
early, bringing his banjo, and by tacit consent, perhaps
to escape Hannah, they both left the house at
once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>Just above the village there was a long, narrow
pond, wooded upon one side and around its upper
end, with partially cleared land and scattered trees
along the opposite bank. One of these trees was a
monster beech near the water&#8217;s edge, the trunk of
which was scarred by many entwined initials.</p>

<p>To this lovers&#8217; trysting tree now came Ray and
Chip.</p>

<p>The evening was not one for romance, for no
moon graced it&#8211;only stars were reflected from the
pond&#8217;s motionless surface, while fireflies twinkled
above it.</p>

<p>The shadow of the near parting also hovered over
these two as, hand in hand, they picked their way
up and along the bank; and once seated beneath
the tree, it seemed to forbid speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d play some of the songs you used to,&#8221;
Chip said at last hurriedly, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m
back at the lake again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glad to do so, Ray drew out his banjo and began
to tune it. He started a song also&#8211;one of the
&#8220;graveyardy&#8221; ones which Old Cy had interdicted,
but choked at once and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sing to-night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m too blue
about going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were two in this frame of mind, evidently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
for Chip made no protest, and for another long
interval they watched the fireflies and listened to
the whippoorwills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you were going back with us,&#8221; Ray said
at last. &#8220;It breaks my heart to go away so soon and
leave you. Why won&#8217;t you let me ask my uncle to
take you? He might be glad to do it, just for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Chip, firmly, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t. It
would shame me so that I couldn&#8217;t look them in
the face.&#8221; Then, as if this subject and their own
feelings must be avoided, she added hurriedly,
&#8220;Tell me what you will do when the folks come
back&#8211;whether you will come with them or stay
at the lake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay there, I suppose,&#8221; answered Ray, somewhat
doggedly, for money-making and love were in conflict.
&#8220;Old Cy says we can make a lot of money if
I will. I wish I were rich,&#8221; he added with a sigh.</p>

<p>He was not the first young man to whom that
wish had come at such a moment. But converse
between them was at ebb tide just now, and the
parting moment, ever creeping nearer, overshadowed
all else. To Chip&#8211;known only to herself&#8211;it
meant forever. To Ray, another long isolation from
all the world and young associates, and all for a few
hundred dollars sorely needed by him, yet seeming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
of scant value compared to the sweet companionship
of this maid.</p>

<p>Then Chip&#8217;s feelings and the reason for them were
quite beyond him. He could not see why she was
unwilling to ask to be taken to the woods again, nor
why she held herself aloof from him. She had not
done so at the lake, or when they met again, and why
should she now?</p>

<p>Something of this might have been inferred by
Chip, for she suddenly arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d best go back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
time, and Hannah will be watching for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Ray might have said had he been a world-wise
man, does not matter. What he did was to
pick up his useless banjo, and clasping Chip&#8217;s arm,
led her along the winding walk.</p>

<p>Below the falls and near the house they paused,
for now the last moment alone together had come,
and with it the real parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Old Cy I&#8211;I haven&#8217;t forgot him,&#8221; whispered
Chip, her voice quivering, &#8220;and&#8211;and&#8211;you
won&#8217;t forget me either, will you, Ray?&#8221;</p>

<p>That little sob in her speech was all that was
needed to break away the barrier between them,
for the next instant Ray&#8217;s arms were about the girl.</p>

<p>No words of love, no protestations, no promises.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
Only one instant&#8217;s meeting of soul and impulse,
fierce as love of life, sacred as the hand of death.</p>

<p>Love consecrated it. The shadowing maples
blessed it. The stars hallowed it.</p>

<p>And yet it was a long, long parting.</p>

<p>When Ray rode away next morning, he watched
for her at the first sharp hilltop.</p>

<p>It was in vain, for Chip&#8217;s resolve had been taken,
and he never saw the forlorn figure crouching behind
that bush-topped wall, or knew that two wistful,
misty eyes had seen him depart.</p>

<p>Few of us ever see even a faint image of ourselves
as others see us; and yet, calm reflection spurred
to self-analysis by a hungry heart occasionally
effects that almost miracle.</p>

<p>In Ray&#8217;s case it did; for after his eager eyes had
scanned every rod of that roadside trysting-place in
vain, a revelation came to him&#8211;not a wide open
one, such as he deserved, but a glance at himself
and his conduct as it had been. First he saw Chip
just as she entered their camp that night in the wilderness,
so pitiful in appearance, so pathetic in her
abject gratitude. Once again he looked at her
appealing eyes growing misty while he played and
sang his old-time love songs. He remembered that
during all the days, weeks, and months following,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
he had never failed to find the love-light of admiration
when his eyes met hers. It had all been a
summer idyl, so sweet, so romantic, so tender, and
so unexpected that he had scarce realized its value&#8211;not at all then, but faintly now.</p>

<p>For all that up-hill, down-dale journey to Riverton,
he lived over this moonlit lake and wilderness camp
episode, and every hour and every thought shared
with him by this girl&#8211;a playmate and lover combined&#8211;returned
again like echoes of past and gone
heart throbs, each time a little sweeter, each time
a trifle more piercing, until his own self-complacency
faded quite away and an abject penitence began to
replace it. For the first time in his callow youth
he began to reflect, and once started on this beneficial
course, the barometer of his vanity fell rapidly.
It was not long ere his own conduct since he returned
to Greenvale also added an assault. He had utterly
failed to realize the meaning of Chip&#8217;s abject devotion&#8211;her
pitiful first-hour confessions of how hard
she had studied, and all for his sake; how she had
counted days and hours until he was likely to return;
how many times she had gone to the hilltop to watch
for him; and even the eagerness of her arms and
the warmth of her lips at that first moment of meeting,
now came back to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>Another and even a more painful self-reproach followed
this&#8211;his own neglect of opportunities and
the result.</p>

<p>He had returned to Greenvale feeling that Chip
was his devoted slave and had found that she was.
Like many another arrogant youth, he had plumed
himself upon that fact, taking everything for granted.
He had yielded to his aunt&#8217;s and other friends&#8217;
coaxings to tell his past winter&#8217;s history of life in
the woods, feeling that Chip could and would wait;
and then, an unexpected and most vexatious frost
had fallen upon his little love-garden, and presto!
his confiding sweetheart, his almost abject slave,
was one no longer.</p>

<p>At the moment of starting, that wildwood camp
and charming lake had seemed a Mecca which he
must hasten to reach once more. When he again
beheld it, it had lost its fairness, and to return to
Greenvale and beg and implore Chip&#8217;s forgiveness&#8211;ay, even kneel to her, if need be&#8211;seemed the
only duty life held.</p>

<p>His punishment had only just begun.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<p class='fs16 c'>PART II<br />VERA RAYMOND</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> a few more days, Chip lived the life that had
now become unbearable, and then the end came.
It was hastened, perhaps, by Hannah, for that ill-tempered
spinster had been ever watchful, and with
shrewd insight had seen or guessed all that had
transpired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose ye know why the Frisbies hurried away
so soon after Ray got back,&#8221; she said to Chip that
last day. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t, I can tell ye. It was &#8217;cos
they noticed the goin&#8217;s on &#8217;tween you an&#8217; him, an&#8217;
wanted to head it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a word of protest came from the poor child
in response to this sneer, and that night she wrote
two notes, one to Miss Phinney, the other to Aunt
Comfort. Then, making a bundle of the few belongings
she could call her own&#8211;the beaded
moccasins, cap, and fur cape old Tomah had given
her, and other trifles&#8211;she waited until almost midnight
and stole out of the house.</p>

<p>Once before she had left her only shelter, in
a more desperate mood. Now the same impulse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
nerved her, and for ample reason. Dependent upon
the bounty of those in no wise kin to her, tortured
by the sarcastic tongue of Hannah, her heart hungering
for a love she believed could never be hers, no
other outcome seemed possible; and defiant still, yet
saddened beyond all words, she set out to escape it all.</p>

<p>Where to go, she knew not nor cared&#8211;only to
leave Greenvale and all the shame, sorrow, and humiliation
it held for her, and make her own way in
the world as best she could.</p>

<p>The village street was as silent as midnight always
found it. The low murmur of the Mizzy Falls
whispered down the valley. A half-moon was just
rising, and as Chip reached the hilltop where she had
waited for Ray, she halted. From here must be
taken the last glance at Greenvale, and as she turned
about a sob rose in her heart, in spite of her stern
resolve, for ties cannot be sundered easily.</p>

<p>And how vivid and life-lasting was that picture!
The two long rows of white houses facing the broad
street, the tall-spired church in the middle of them;
scattered dwellings to the right and left; away to one
side the little brown schoolhouse that had been her
Mecca; the stream that wound through the broad
meadows; and over all the faint sheen of the rising
moon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>Only for a moment she paused for this good-bye
look, then turned and ran. On and on she sped
mile after mile, up hill, down hill, halting now and
then for breath until a cross-road was reached, and
here she stopped. Here also came the question of
direction. To follow the main road was to reach
Riverton, between which and Greenvale the stage
journeyed. To go there meant being recognized
perhaps. In her study of geography, she had found
that the village which was her birthplace lay northeast
from Greenvale. She meant sometime and
somehow to reach that spot and visit her mother&#8217;s
grave once more, and also, if possible, to send word
to Old Tomah. And so guided by this vague plan,
she turned to the left.</p>

<p>From now on the road became narrow. Miles
elapsed between houses, and Chip, wearied and
heavy-eyed, could only creep along. The way
became more devious now, bending around a wooded
hill and then crossing a wide swamp to enter a stretch
of forest. Direction became lost in these turnings,
the road grew hilly and less travelled. The moon
scarce showed it; and Chip, almost exhausted,
stumbled over stones and felt that she was becoming
lost in an unsettled country. And then, just as she
emerged from a thicket and ascended a low hill, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
light of coming dawn faced her, and with it the need
of sleep and concealment.</p>

<p>Full well she knew she must avoid all observing
eyes and place many more miles between herself and
Greenvale to be certain of escape. And then, as
the daylight increased, she caught sight of an old,
almost ruined dwelling half hid among bushes just
ahead. Even if empty, as it appeared, it would
serve for shelter, and finding it so, she crept in, so
wearied that she fell asleep at once on the warped
and mouldy floor.</p>

<p>It was only a brief nap, for soon the rattle of a
passing farm wagon woke her, but refreshed somewhat
by it, she again pushed on.</p>

<p>Soon a brook, singing cheerfully as it tumbled
down a ledge, was reached, and here Chip bathed
her face and hands and drank of the sweet, cool
water.</p>

<p>Hunger also asserted itself, but that did not daunt
her. She had faced it once before.</p>

<p>Then something of a plan as to her future movements
began to shape itself in her mind, following
which came an increased courage and self-reliance.
Not a cent did she now possess. Food she could
not have until she had made good her escape and
could earn it somewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>But the sun was shining, the birds were singing,
her young, supple body was strong, life and the
world were ahead; and, best of all, never again
would she have to feel herself a dependent upon
any one.</p>

<p>With these blessings, scant to most of us, hardened
as she had been by servitude at Tim&#8217;s Place, came a
certain buoyancy of spirit and defiance of all things
human.</p>

<p>No wild beasts were here to menace, no spites to
creep and crawl along fence or hedgerow, no hideous
half-breed to pursue, and as she counted her blessings,
while her spirits rose, a new life and new hope
came to her.</p>

<p>And now another feeling came&#8211;the certainty
that she had come so far that no one would recognize
her. At first that morning, when she heard a team
coming or overtaking her, she had hidden by the
roadside until it passed. When a house was sighted
ahead, she made a wide detour in the fields to avoid
it. Now this sense of caution vanished, and she
strode on fearless and confident.</p>

<p>When night came again she crept into an unused
sheep barn, and when daylight wakened her, she
hurried on once more.</p>

<p>During all that first day&#8217;s journey, her one fear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
had been that some one she would meet might recognize
her and report the fact in Greenvale. To
avoid that had been her sole thought. Now that
feeling of danger was vanishing, and when people
were met, she looked at them fearlessly and kept on.
When cross-roads were reached and a choice in ways
became necessary, she followed the one nearest to
northeast, and for the reason that her school map
had shown that her birthplace lay in this direction.
How far away it was, she had not the faintest idea,
or whether she could live to reach it. Her sole
thought was to escape Greenvale and the humiliating
life of dependence there, and when she was so
far away that no one could find her, obtain work
at some farm-house.</p>

<p>All that second day she plodded on that same
patient up-hill, down-dale journey, never halting
except to pick a few berries, or where a brook crossed
the road to obtain a handful of watercress or some
sweet-flag buds.</p>

<p>Now and then villages were passed, again it was
country sparsely settled, where farm-houses were
wide apart, and when this day was waning, even
these had vanished and she found herself in almost
a wilderness once more.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please give me a lift an&#8217; a chance to earn my vittles for a day or two?&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>Hills now met her already weary feet; they seemed
never ending, for as the crown of one was reached,
another met her eyes. The roadway also became
badly gullied, always stony, with grass growing in
the hollows.</p>

<p>By now she was faint and dizzy from two days&#8217;
fasting, and so footsore that she could scarce limp
along. So far her defiant pride had kept her from
begging food, but now that was weakening, and at
the next house she would have asked a morsel. But
no next house came. Only the same scrub growth
along the wayside with now and then a patch of
forest, with never a fence, even, to indicate human
ownership.</p>

<p>The sun had now vanished. Already the stretches
of forest were shadowy, and as Chip reached the
apex of another long hill, beyond and far below she
could see another darkened valley. Night seemed
creeping up from it to meet her. Not a house, not
even a fence or recent clearing&#8211;only the unending
tangle of green growth and this dark vale beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll starve &#8217;fore I find another house,&#8221;
poor Chip muttered, and then as the utter desolation
of her situation and surroundings were realized for
a moment, her defiant courage gave way.</p>

<p>For two days and half a night she had plodded on
without food and with scarce a moment&#8217;s rest. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
feet were blistered, her eyes smarted from sun and
dust, her head swam. She was miles away from
any human habitation, footsore, weary, and despondent,
with night enclosing her&#8211;a homeless waif, still
clinging to the small bundle that contained her all.</p>

<p>But now as she crouched by the roadside, too
exhausted to move on, the memory of those three
days and nights of horror, one year ago, came to her.
Her plight was bad enough now, but nothing to
compare with what it was then, and as all the terror
and desperation of that mad flight now returned, it
renewed her courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so bad off as I was then,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure of finding a house to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, as if this moment marked the turning-point
of her fortunes, from far down the hill she had
climbed, came the faint creak, creak, and jolting
sound of an ascending wagon. Slowly it neared,
until just at the hilltop where Chip sat, the tired
horse halted, and its driver saw her rise almost
beside the wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m nearly tuckered out and
&#8217;bout starved. Won&#8217;t you please give me a lift an&#8217;
a chance to earn my vittles for a day or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave a low whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why sartin, sartin,&#8221; he answered in a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
&#8220;but who be ye? I thought for a minute ye was a
sperit. Git up here,&#8221; he added, without waiting for
a reply and moving to make room. Then as Chip
obeyed, he chirruped to his horse and down the hill
they rattled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who might be ye, girlie, an&#8217; whar&#8217;d ye come
from?&#8221; he asked again, as they came to another
ascent and the horse walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Vera, Vera&#8211;Raymond,&#8221; answered
Chip, &#8220;an&#8217; I run away from where I was livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curis,&#8221; answered the old man, glancing
at her; &#8220;whar&#8217;d ye run away from, some poor farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Chip, almost defiantly, &#8220;but I
guess I was a sort o&#8217; pauper. I was livin&#8217; with
folks that fetched me out o&#8217; the woods an&#8217; was
schoolin&#8217; me, and I couldn&#8217;t stand it, so I run away.
I don&#8217;t want to tell where they be, or where I came
from either,&#8221; she added in a moment, &#8220;for I don&#8217;t
want them ever to find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that&#8217;s a proper sort o&#8217; feelin&#8217;,&#8221; responded
the man, still looking at his passenger, &#8220;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
mind. I live down beyond here in what&#8217;s called
the Holler. Somebody called it Peaceful Valley
once. We&#8217;ll take keer o&#8217; ye to-night &#8217;n&#8217; to-morrer
we&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s best to be done. I guess ye need
a hum &#8217;bout ez bad ez a body kin, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>And so Chip McGuire, waif of the wilderness and
erstwhile protégée of a philanthropic woman, as Vera
Raymond found another home, and began still
another life with this old farmer, Judson Walker,
and his wife Mandy.</p>

<p>But a sorrow deeper far than Chip ever realized
fell upon Aunt Comfort when her brimming eyes
read her note the morning after her flight.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Dear Aunt Comfort</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand Hannah or being a pauper any
longer. She as good as told me I wanted your
money and I never thought of it. She said I wasn&#8217;t
good enough for Ray, either, and that was the reason
Mrs. Frisbie took him away so soon. I know I
ain&#8217;t good for nothin&#8217; nor nobody, but I didn&#8217;t ask
to be fetched here and I am going away, never, never,
never to come back. If ever I can, I will pay you

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s a heap o&#8217; comfort in lookin&#8217; on the dark side o&#8217;
life cheerfully.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Old Cy</span> especially found life dull after Ray had
gone. The hermit also appeared to miss him and
became more morose than ever. He never had been
what might be termed social, speaking only when
spoken to, and then only in the fewest possible
words. Now Old Cy became almost a walking
sphinx, and found that time passed slowly. His
heartstrings had somehow become entwined with
Ray&#8217;s hopes and plans. He had bent every energy
and thought to secure for Ray a valuable stock of
furs and gum, and, as was his nature, felt a keen
satisfaction in helping that youth to a few hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>Now Ray had departed, furs, gum, and all. He
had promised to return with Martin and Angie later
on, but of that Old Cy felt somewhat dubious, and
so the old man mourned.</p>

<p>There was no real reason for it, for all Nature was
now smiling. The lake was blue and rippled by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
the June breezes; trout leaped out of it night and
morning; flowers were blooming, squirrels frisking,
birds singing and nest-building; and what Old Cy
most enjoyed, the vernal season was at hand.</p>

<p>Another matter also disturbed him&#8211;the whereabouts
of McGuire and the half-breed, Pete Bolduc.</p>

<p>Levi had brought the information that neither had
been seen nor heard of since the previous autumn;
but that was not conclusive, and somehow Old Cy
felt that a certain mystery had attached itself to them,
and once we suspect a mystery, it pursues us like a
phantom. He did not fear either of these renegades,
however. He had never harmed them. But he
felt that any day might bring a call from one or the
other, or that some tragic outcome would be disclosed.</p>

<p>Another problem also annoyed him&#8211;who this
thief of their game could be, and whether his supposed
cave lair was a permanent hiding-spot.</p>

<p>Two reasons had kept Old Cy from another visit
to that sequestered lake during the fall trapping
season: first, its evident danger, and then lack of
time. But now, with nothing to do except wait
for the incoming ones, an impulse to visit again this
mysterious spot came to him.</p>

<p>He had, at the former excursion, felt almost certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
that this unknown trapper was either McGuire
or the half-breed. Some assertions made by Levi
seemed to corroborate that theory, and impelled by
it, Old Cy started alone, one morning, to visit this
lake again. It took him until midday to carry his
canoe, camp outfit, rifle, and all across from stream
to stream, and twilight had come ere he reached the
lagoon where he and Ray had left the main stream
and camped. Up here Old Cy now turned his canoe,
and repairing the bark shack they had built, which
had been crushed by winter&#8217;s snow, he camped
there again.</p>

<p>Next morning, bright and early, he launched his
canoe and once more followed the winding stream
through the dark gorge and out into the rippled lake
again.</p>

<p>Here he halted and looked about.</p>

<p>No signs of aught human could be seen. The long,
narrow lakelet sparkled beneath the morning sun.
The bald mountain frowned upon it, the jagged
ledges just across faced him like serried ramparts,
an eagle slowly circled overhead, and, best indication
of primal solitude, an antlered deer stood looking at
him from out an opening above the ledges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m alone here!&#8221; exclaimed Old Cy,
glancing around; &#8220;but if this ain&#8217;t a pictur worth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
rememberin&#8217;, I never saw one. Wish I could take
it with me into t&#8217;other world; an&#8217; if I was sure o&#8217;
findin&#8217; a spot like it thar, I&#8217;d never worry &#8217;bout
goin&#8217; when my time comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a long wait, as if he wanted to observe
every detail of this wondrous picture of wildwood
beauty, he dipped his paddle, crossed the sheet of
rippled water, and stepped ashore at the very spot
where he and Ray had landed over eight months
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he exclaimed, glancing around,
&#8220;if thar ain&#8217;t a canoe, bottom up! Two, by ginger!&#8221;
he added, as he saw another drawn out and half hid
by a low ledge.</p>

<p>To this second one he hastened at once, and looked
into it.</p>

<p>It had evidently rested there all winter, for it was
partially filled with water, and half afloat in it were
two paddles and a setting pole. A gunny-cloth bag,
evidently containing the usual cooking outfit of a
woodsman, lay soaking in one end, a frying-pan
and an axe were rusting in the other, and a coating
of mould had browned each crossbar and thwart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been here quite a spell, all winter, I guess,&#8221;
muttered Old Cy, looking it over, and then he
advanced to the other canoe. That was, as he asserted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
bottom up, and also lay half hid back of a
jutting ledge of slate. Two paddles leaned against
this ledge, and near by was another setting pole. All
three of these familiar objects were brown with damp
mould and evidently had rested there many months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curis, curis,&#8221; muttered Old Cy again. &#8220;I
callated I&#8217;d find nothin&#8217; here, &#8217;n&#8217; here&#8217;s two canoes
left to rot, &#8217;n&#8217; been here all winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with a vague sense of need, he returned to
his canoe, seized his rifle, looked all around, over the
lake, up into the green tangle above the ledges, and
finally followed the narrow passage leading to where
he had once watched smoke arise. Here on top of
this ledge he again halted and looked about.</p>

<p>Back of it was the same V-shaped cleft across
which a cord had held drying pelts, the cord was
still there, and below it he could see the dark skins
amid the confusion of jagged stones.</p>

<p>Turning, he stepped from this ledge to the lower
one nearer the lake, walked down its slope, and
looked about again. At its foot was a long, narrow,
shelf-like projection, ending at the corner of the ledge.
Old Cy followed this to its end and stepped down into
a narrow crevasse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he exclaimed, taking a backward
step as he did so.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>And well he might, for there at his feet lay a rifle
coated with rust beside a brown felt hat.</p>

<p>Had a grinning skull met his eyes, he would not
have been more astounded. In fact, that was the
next object he expected to see, and he glanced up
and down the crevasse for it. None leered at him,
however, and picking up the rusted weapon, he
continued his search.</p>

<p>Two rods or so below where he had climbed the
upper ledge, he was halted again, for there, at his
hand almost, was a curious doorlike opening some
three feet high and one foot wide, back of an outstanding
slab of slate.</p>

<p>The two abandoned canoes had surprised him, the
rusty rifle astonished him, but this, a self-evident
cave entrance, almost took his breath away.</p>

<p>For one instant he glanced at it, stepped back a
step, dropped the rusty rifle and cocked his own,
as if expecting a ghost or panther to emerge. None
came, however, and once more Old Cy advanced
and peered into this opening. A faint light illumined
its interior&#8211;a weird slant of sunlight, yet enough
to show a roomy cavern.</p>

<p>The mystery was solved. This surely was the
hiding-spot of the strange trapper!</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t see why I missed it afore,&#8221; Old Cy muttered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
kneeling that he might better look within, and sniffing
at the peculiar odor. &#8220;Wonder if the cuss is
dead in thar, or what smells so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he arose and grasped the slab of slate. One
slight pull and it fell aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nat&#8217;ral door, by hokey!&#8221; exclaimed Old Cy,
and once more he knelt and looked in.</p>

<p>The bravest man will hesitate a moment before
entering such a cavern, prefaced, so to speak, by
two abandoned canoes, a rusty rifle, human head
covering, each and all bespeaking something tragic,
and Old Cy was no exception. That he had come
upon some grewsome mystery was apparent. Canoes
were not left to rot in the wilderness or rifles dropped
without cause.</p>

<p>And then, that hat!</p>

<p>Surely here, or hereabout, had been enacted a
drama of murderous nature, and inside this cavern
might repose its blood-stained sequel.</p>

<p>But the filtering beams of light encouraged Old
Cy, and he entered. No ghastly corpse confronted
him, but instead a human, if cramped, abode. A
fireplace deftly fashioned of slate occupied one side
of this cave; in front a low table of the same flat
stone, resting upon small ones; and upon the table
were rusty tin dishes, a few mouldy hardtack, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
knife, fork, and scraps of meat, exhaling the odor of
decay. A smell of smoke from the charred wood in
the fireplace mingled with it all. In one corner was
a bed of brown fir twigs, also mouldy, a blanket,
and tanned deerskins.</p>

<p>The cave was of oval, irregular shape, barely high
enough for Old Cy to stand upright. Across its
roof, on either side of the rude chimney, a narrow
crack admitted light, and as he looked about, he
saw in the dim light another doorlike opening into
still another cave. Into this he peered, but could
see nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A queer livin&#8217; spot,&#8221; he muttered at last, &#8220;a
reg&#8217;lar human panther den. An&#8217; &#8217;twas out o&#8217; this
I seen the smoke come. An&#8217; here&#8217;s his gun,&#8221; he
added, as, more accustomed to the dim light, he saw
one in a corner. &#8220;Two guns, two canoes, an&#8217;
nobody to hum,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m safe, anyhow.
But I&#8217;ve got to peek into that other cave, sartin
sure,&#8221; and he withdrew to the open air.</p>

<p>A visit to a couple of birches soon provided means
of light, and he again entered the cave. One moment
more, and then a flaring torch of bark was
thrust into the inner cave, a mere crevasse not four
feet wide, and stooping, as he now had to, Old Cy
entered and knelt while he looked about.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>He saw nothing here of interest except the serried
rows of jutting slate, across two of which lay a slab
of the same&#8211;no vestige of aught human, and Old
Cy was about to retreat when his flare burning close
to his finger tips unnoticed, caused him to drop it on
the instant, and drawing another from his pocket
he lit it while the flame lasted in the first one.</p>

<p>It is said that great discoveries are almost invariably
made by some trifling accident&#8211;a gold mine
found by stumbling over a stone, a valley prolific
of diamonds disclosed by digging for water.</p>

<p>In this case it was true, for as Old Cy bent to
light his second torch ere he withdrew from the
inner cave, a flash of reflected light came from
beneath this slab&#8211;only for one second, but enough
to attract his attention.</p>

<p>He stooped again and lifted the slab. Six large
tin cans had been hidden by it. He grasped one
and could scarce lift it. Again his fingers closed
over it. He crawled backward to the better-lighted
cave and drew the cover off the can with eager motion,
and poured a heap of shining, glittering coin out upon
that food-littered table.</p>

<p>Into that dark hole he dived again, as a starved
dog leaps for food, seized the cans, two at a time,
almost tumbled back, and emptied them. Four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
had been filled with gold coin and two stuffed with
paper money.</p>

<p>Folded with these bills of all denominations from
one to fifty dollars was a legal paper yellowed by
age, with a red seal still glowing like a spot of blood.</p>

<p>It was an innholder&#8217;s license, authorizing one
Thomas McGuire to furnish food, shelter, and entertainment
for man and beast.</p>

<p>With eyes almost tear-dimmed and heart throbbing
at having found poor Chip&#8217;s splendid heritage,
Old Cy now gazed at it.</p>

<p>The sharp stones upon which he knelt nearly
pierced his flesh, but he felt them not.</p>

<p>The glint of sunlight from the crack above caressed
his scant gray hairs and white fringing beard, forming
almost a halo, yet he knew it not.</p>

<p>He only knew that here, before him, on this rude
stone table, lay thousands of dollars, all belonging
to the child he loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, little gal,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
found what belongs to ye, &#8217;n&#8217; ye hain&#8217;t got to want
for nothin&#8217; no more. I wish I could kiss ye now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did he realize that at this very moment of
thankfulness for her sake, poor Chip was lost to all
who knew her, and, half starved and almost hopeless,
knew not where to find shelter.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;When life looks darkest to ye, count yer blessin&#8217;s, boy,
count yer blessin&#8217;s.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> the sun rose again and Chip awoke, she
scarce knew where she was. Outside, and almost
reaching the one window of her little room, was the
top of an apple tree in full bloom. Below she could
hear ducks quacking, now and then a barnyard
monarch&#8217;s defiant crow, from farther away came
the rippling sound of running water, and as she
lay and listened to the medley, a robin lit on the tree-top
not ten feet away and chirped as he peered into
her window. A scent of lavender mingled with
apple blossoms became noticeable; then the few
and very old-fashioned fittings of the room,&#8211;a chest
of drawers with little brass handles, over it a narrow
mirror with gilt frame, two wood-seated chairs
painted blue, and white muslin curtains draped
away from the window.</p>

<p>And now, conscious that she was in some strange
place, back in an instant came the three days of her
long, weary tramp, the nights when she had slept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
in a sheep barn and in a deserted dwelling, and at
last, faint, footsore, and almost hopeless, she had
been rescued from another night with only the sky
for a roof.</p>

<p>Then the quaint old man, so much like Old Cy,
whom she had accosted, the rattling, bumping ride
down into this valley, and the halt where a cheery
light beamed its welcome and a motherly woman
made it real.</p>

<p>It was all so unexpected, so satisfying, so protective
of herself, that Chip could hardly realize how
it had come about.</p>

<p>No questions had been asked of her here. These
two quaint old people had taken her as she was&#8211;dusty,
dirty, and travel-worn. She had bathed
and been helped to an ample meal and shown to
this sweet-smelling room as if she had been their
own daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be awful kind sort o&#8217; people,&#8221; Chip
thought, and then creeping out of bed she dressed,
and taking her stockings and sadly worn shoes in
hand softly descended the stairs.</p>

<p>No one seemed astir anywhere. The ticking of
a tall clock in the sitting room was the only sound,
the back door was wide open, and out of this
Chip passed and, seating herself on a bench, began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
putting on stockings and shoes. This was scarce
done ere she heard a step and saw the old man
emerge from the same door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Pattycake, how air ye?&#8221; he asked, smiling.
&#8220;I heerd ye creepin&#8217; downstairs like a mouse, but I
was up, &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;bout dressed. Hope ye slept well. It&#8217;s
Sunday,&#8221; he added, without waiting for a reply, &#8220;an&#8217;
we don&#8217;t git up quite so arly ez usual. Ye can help
Mandy &#8217;bout breakfast now, if ye like, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ll do the
milkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this marked the entry of Chip into the new
home, and outlined her duties. No more questions
were asked of her. She was taken at her own valuation&#8211;a
needy girl, willing to work for her board,
insisting on it, and yet, in a few days, so hospitable
were these people and so winsome was Chip, that
she stepped into their affection, as it were, almost
without effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we best quiz her much,&#8221; Uncle
Jud (as he was known) said to his wife that first
night. &#8220;I found her on the top o&#8217; Bangall Hill,
where she riz up like a ghost. She &#8217;lowed she run
away from somewhar, but where &#8217;twas, she didn&#8217;t
want to tell. My &#8217;pinion is thar&#8217;s a love &#8217;fair at the
bottom on&#8217;t all; but whether it&#8217;s so or not, it ain&#8217;t
none o&#8217; our business. She needs a home, sartin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
sure. She says she means to airn her keep, which
is the right sperit, an&#8217; long as she minds us, she kin
have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Chip &#8220;airned her keep&#8221; and something
more was soon evinced, for in two weeks it was
&#8220;Aunt Mandy&#8221; and &#8220;Uncle Jud&#8221; from her, and
&#8220;Patty&#8221; or &#8220;Pattycake,&#8221; the nickname given her
that first morning, from them. More than that,
so rapidly had she won her way here that by now
Uncle Jud had visited the Riggsville store, some
four miles down this valley, and materials for two
dresses, new shoes, a broad sun hat, and other
much-needed clothing were bought for Chip.</p>

<p>Neither was it all one-sided, for these people,
well-to-do in their isolated home, were also quite
alone. Their two boys had grown up, gone away
and married, and had homes of their own, and the
company of a bright and winsome girl like Chip
was needed in this home.</p>

<p>Her adoption and acceptance of it were like a
small stream flowing into a larger one, for the reason
that these people were almost primitive in location
and custom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t go to meetin&#8217; Sundays,&#8221; Uncle Jud
had explained that first day after breakfast. &#8220;We&#8217;re
sorter heathen, I s&#8217;pose; but then ag&#8217;in, thar ain&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
no chance. Thar used to be meetin&#8217;s down to the
Corners, &#8217;n&#8217; a parson; but he only got four hundred a
year, an&#8217; hard work to collect that, &#8217;n&#8217; so he gin the
job up. Since then the meetin&#8217;-house has kinder
gone to pieces, &#8217;n&#8217; the Corner folks use it now for
storin&#8217; tools. We obsarve Sundays here by bein&#8217;
sorter lazy, &#8217;n&#8217; I go fishin&#8217; some or pickin&#8217; berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Chip, reared at Tim&#8217;s Place, and whose knowledge
of Sunday was its strict observance at Greenvale,
this seemed a relief. Sundays there had never
been pleasant days to her. She could not understand
what the preaching and praying meant, or
why people needed to look so solemn on that day.
She had been stared at so much at church, also, that
the ordeal had become painful. The parson had,
on two occasions, glared and glowered at her while
he assured her that her opinions and belief in spites
were rank heresy and that she was a wicked heathen;
and, all in all, religion was not to her taste. With
these people she was to escape it, and instead of
being imprisoned for long, weary hours while being
stared at each Sunday, she was likely to have perfect
freedom and a chance to go with this nice old
man on a fishing or berry-picking jaunt.</p>

<p>And then Uncle Jud was so much like Old Cy
in ways and speech that her heart was won. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
besides these blessings, the old farm-house, hidden
away between two ranges of wooded hills, seemed
so out of the world and so secure from observation
that she felt that no one from Greenvale ever could
or would discover her. She had meant to hide
herself from all who knew her, had changed her
name for that purpose, and here and now it was
accomplished.</p>

<p>That first Sunday, also, became a halcyon one for
her, for after chores, in the performance of which
Chip made herself useful, Uncle Jud took his fish-pole,
and giving her the basket to carry, led the way
to the brook, and for four bright sunny hours, Chip
knew not the lapse of time while she watched the
leaping, laughing stream, and her second Old Cy
pulling trout from each pool and cascade.</p>

<p>And so her new life began.</p>

<p>But the change was not made without some cost
to her feelings, for heartstrings reach far, and Miss
Phinney and her months of patient teaching were
not forgotten.</p>

<p>Aunt Comfort and her benign face oft returned
to Chip, &#8220;and dear Old Cy,&#8221; as she always thought
of him, still oftener. Ray&#8217;s face also lingered in her
heart. Now and then she caught herself humming
some darky song, and never once did the moon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
smile into this quiet vale that her thoughts did not
speed away to that wildwood lake, with its rippled
path of silver, the dark bordering forest, and how
she wielded a paddle while her young lover picked
his banjo.</p>

<p>No word or hint of all this bygone life and romance
ever fell from her lips. It was a page in her memory
that must never be turned,&#8211;an idyl to be forgotten,&#8211;and yet forget it she could not, in spite of will or
wishes.</p>

<p>And now as the summer days sped by, and Chip
helping Uncle Jud in the meadows or Aunt Mandy
about the house, and winning love from both, saw
a new realm open before her. There was in the
sitting room of this quaint home a tall bookcase,
its shelves filled with a motley collection of books:
works on science, astronomy, geology, botany, and
the like; books of travel and adventure; stories of
strange countries and people never heard of by Chip;
and novels by Scott, Lever, Cooper, and Hardy.
These last, especially Scott and Cooper, appealed
most to Chip, and once she began them, every spare
hour, and often until long past midnight, she became
lost in this new world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about how folks live in the woods,&#8221;
she said one Sunday to Uncle Jud, when half through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
&#8220;The Deerslayer.&#8221; &#8220;I was brought up there. I
know how Injuns live and what they believe. I
had an old Injun friend once. I&#8217;ve got the moccasins
and fur cape he gave me now. His name was
Tomah, &#8217;n&#8217; he believed in queer things that sometimes
creep an&#8217; sometimes run faster&#8217;n we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was her first reference to her old life, but once
begun, she never paused until all her queer history
had been related.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to tell it,&#8221; she explained in conclusion,
&#8220;for I don&#8217;t want nobody to know where I
came from, an&#8217; I hope you won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>How near she came to disclosing what was of far
more importance to herself and these people than
old Tomah&#8217;s superstition she never knew, or that
all that saved her was her reference to Old Cy by
that name only.</p>

<p>More than that, and like Old Cy standing over
the cave where her heritage lay hid, she had no suspicion
that this kindly old man, so much like him
in looks and speech, was his brother.</p>

<p>With the coming of September, however, a visitor
was announced. &#8220;Aunt Abby&#8217;s comin&#8217; to stay
with us a spell,&#8221; Uncle Jud said that day; &#8220;she&#8217;s
Mandy&#8217;s sister, Abigail Bemis, an&#8217; she lives at
Christmas Cove. It&#8217;s a shore town, &#8217;bout a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
miles from here. She ain&#8217;t much like Mandy,&#8221; he
added confidentially to Chip; &#8220;she&#8217;s more book-larned,
so you&#8217;ll have to mind your <i>p</i>&#8217;s and <i>q</i>&#8217;s. If
ye like, ye can go with me to the station to meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that a few days later, Chip,
dressed in her best, rode to the station with Uncle
Jud in the old carryall, and there met this visitor.</p>

<p>She was not a welcome guest, so far as Chip was
concerned, wonted as she had now become to Uncle
Jud and Aunt Mandy, whose speech, like her own,
was not &#8220;book-larned,&#8221; and for this reason, Chip
felt afraid of her. So much so, in fact, that for a
few days she scarce dared speak at all.</p>

<p>Her timidity wore away in due time, for Aunt
Abby&#8211;a counterpart of her sister&#8211;was in no
wise awe-inspiring. She saw Chip as she was, and
soon felt an interest in her and her peculiar history,
or what was known of it. She also noted Chip&#8217;s
interest in books, and guessing more than she had
been told, was not long in forming correct conclusions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you intend to do with this runaway
girl?&#8221; she said one day to her sister, &#8220;keep her here
and let her grow up in ignorance, or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, we ain&#8217;t thought much about that,&#8221; responded
Mandy, &#8220;at least not yet. She ain&#8217;t got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
no relations to look arter her, so far ez we kin larn.
She&#8217;s company for us, &#8217;n&#8217; willin&#8217;. Uncle Jud sets
lots of store by her. She is with him from morn till
night, and handy at all sorts o&#8217; work. This is how
&#8217;tis with us here, an&#8217; now what do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Aunt Abby meditated. &#8220;You
ought to do your duty by her,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;and
she certainly needs more schooling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can send her down to the Corners when school
begins, if you think we orter,&#8221; returned her sister,
timidly; &#8220;but we hate to lose her now. We&#8217;ve
kinder took to her, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think that will do,&#8221; answered Aunt
Abby, knowing as she did that the three <i>R</i>&#8217;s comprised
the full extent of an education at the Corners.
&#8220;What she needs is a chance to mingle with more
people than she can here, and learn the ways of the
world, as well as books. Her mind is bright. I
notice she is reading every chance she can get, and
you know my ideas about education. For her to
stay here, even with schooling at the Corners, is to
let her grow up like a hoyden. Now what would
you think if I took her back to Christmas Cove?
There is a better school there. She will meet and
mingle with more people, and improve faster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno what Judson&#8217;ll say,&#8221; returned Aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
Mandy, somewhat sadly. &#8220;He&#8217;s got so wonted to
her, he&#8217;ll be heart-broke, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221; And so the
consultation closed.</p>

<p>The matter did not end here, for Aunt Abby,
&#8220;sot in her way,&#8221; as Uncle Jud had often said, yet
in reality only advocating what she felt was best for
this homeless waif, now began a persuasive campaign.
She enlarged on Christmas Cove, its excellent school
and capable master, its social advantages and cultured
people, who boasted a public library and debating
society, and especially its summer attractions,
when a few dozen city people sojourned there. Its
opportunities for church-going also came in for
praise, though if this worthy woman had known how
Chip felt about that feature, it would have been left
unmentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl needs religious influence and contact
with believers, as well as schooling,&#8221; she said later
on to Aunt Mandy, &#8220;and that must be considered.
Here she can have none, and will grow up a heathen.
I certainly think she ought to go back with me for a
year or two, at least, and then we can decide what is
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s one thing ye ain&#8217;t thought &#8217;bout,&#8221; Mandy
answered, &#8220;an&#8217; that&#8217;s her sense o&#8217; obligation. From
what she&#8217;s told me, &#8217;twas that that made her run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
away from whar she was, &#8217;n&#8217; she&#8217;d run away from
here if she didn&#8217;t feel she was earnin&#8217; her keep.
She&#8217;s peculiar in that way, &#8217;n&#8217; can&#8217;t stand feelin&#8217;
she&#8217;s dependent. How you goin&#8217; to get round that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you do,&#8221; returned Aunt Abby, not at
all discouraged. &#8220;We live about as you do, as you
know, only Mr. Bemis has the mill; and she can
help me about the house, as she does here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip&#8217;s own consent to this new plan was the
hardest to obtain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do just as Uncle Jud wants me to,&#8221; she responded,
when Aunt Abby proposed the change;
&#8220;but I&#8217;d hate to go &#8217;way from here. It&#8217;s all the real
sort o&#8217; home I&#8217;ve ever known, and they&#8217;ve been so
good to me I&#8217;ll have to cry when I leave it. You&#8217;d
let me come here once in a while, wouldn&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she seemed ready to cry at this moment, Aunt
Abby wisely dropped the subject then and there;
in fact, she did not allude to it again in Chip&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>But Aunt Abby carried her point with the others.
Uncle Jud consented very reluctantly, Aunt Mandy
also yielded after much more persuasion, and when
Aunt Abby&#8217;s visit terminated, poor Chip&#8217;s few
belongings were packed in a new telescope case;
she kissed Aunt Mandy, unable to speak, and this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
tearful parting was repeated at the station with
Uncle Jud. When the train had vanished he wiped
his eyes on his coat sleeves, climbed into his old
carryall, and drove away disconsolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curis, curis, how a gal like that &#8217;un&#8217;ll work her
way into a man&#8217;s feelin&#8217;s,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t been three months since I picked her up, &#8217;n&#8217;
now her goin&#8217; away seems like pullin&#8217; my heart out.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Christmas Cove</span> had entered its autumn lethargy
when Aunt Abby Bemis and her new protégée reached
it. Captain Bemis, who &#8220;never had no say &#8217;bout
nothin&#8217;,&#8221; but who had cooked his own meals uncomplainingly
for three weeks, emerged, white-dusted,
from the mill, to greet the arrivals, and Chip
was soon installed in a somewhat bare room overlooking
the cove. Everything seemed slightly chilly
to her here. This room, with its four-poster bed,
blue-painted chairs, light blue shades, and dark
blue straw matting, the leafless elms in front, the
breeze that swept in from the sea, and even her reception,
seemed cool. Her heart was not in it.
Try as she would, she could not yet feel one spark
of affection for this &#8220;book-larned&#8221; Aunt Abby, who
had already begun to reprove her for lapses of speech.
It was all so different from the home life she had
just left; and as Chip had now begun to notice and
feel trifles, the relations of the people seemed as
chilly as the room to which she was consigned.</p>

<p>When Sunday came&#8211;a sunless one with leaden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
sky and cold wind bearing the ocean&#8217;s moaning&#8211;Chip
felt herself back at Greenvale with its Sundays,
for now she was stared at the moment she entered
the church. The singing was, of course, of the same
solemn character, the minister&#8217;s prayers even longer,
and the preaching as incomprehensible as in Greenvale.</p>

<p>To Chip, doubtless a heretic who needed regeneration,
it seemed a melancholy and solemn performance.
The sermon (on predestination, with a finale which
was a description of the resurrection day) made her
feel creepy, and when the white-robed procession
rising from countless graves was touched upon,
and a pause came when she could hear the ocean&#8217;s
distant moan once more, it seemed that spites were
creeping and crawling all about that dim room.</p>

<p>With her advent at school Monday came something
of the same trouble first met at Greenvale,
for the master, a weazen, dried-up little old man,
who wore a wig and seemed to exude rules and discipline,
lacked the kindly interest of Miss Phinney.</p>

<p>Chip, almost a mature young lady, was aligned
with girls and boys of ten and twelve, and once more
the same shame and humiliation had to be endured.
It wore away in time, however, for she had made
almost marvellous progress under Miss Phinney.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
Her mind was keen and quick, and once at study
again, she astonished Mr. Bell, the master.</p>

<p>Something of her old fearless self-reliance now
came to her aid, also. It had made her dare sixty
miles of wilderness alone and helpless, it had
spurred her to escape Greenvale and her sense of
being a dependent pauper, and now that latent force
for good or ill still nerved her.</p>

<p>But Christmas Cove did not suit her. The sea
that drew her eyes with its vastness seemed to awe
her. The great house, brown and moss-coated,
where she lived, was barnlike, and never quite
warm enough. The long street she traversed four
times daily was bleak and wind-swept. Aunt
Abby was austere and lacking in cordiality; and
Sundays&#8211;well, Sundays were Chip&#8217;s one chief
abhorrence.</p>

<p>She may be blamed for it,&#8211;doubtless will be,&#8211;and
yet she never had been, and it seemed never
would be, quite reconciled to Sundays. At Tim&#8217;s
Place they were unknown. At Greenvale they had
been dreaded, and now at Christmas Cove they
were no less so.</p>

<p>At Uncle Jud&#8217;s, in Peaceful Valley, where she had
found an asylum, loving care, and companionship
akin to her, Sundays were only half-Sundays&#8211;days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
of chore-doing, of reading, of rest, or long
strolls along shady lanes with Uncle Jud, or following
the brook and watching him fish. It was not
right, maybe. It was somewhat of sacrilege, perhaps,
this lazy, summer-day-strolling, flower-picking,
berry-gathering way of passing them, and yet, as
the months with Martin and his party in the wilderness
where Sunday could not be observed, and those
with Uncle Jud were all that Chip had really enjoyed,
she must not be blamed.</p>

<p>Another influence&#8211;an insidious heart-hunger she
could not put away&#8211;now added to her loneliness
in the new life. It carried her thoughts back to the
rippled, moonlit lake, where Ray had picked his
banjo and sung to her; even back to that first night
by the camp-fire when she had watched and listened
to him in rapt admiration. It thrilled her as naught
else could when she recalled the few moments at the
lake when, unconscious of the need of restraint, she
had let him caress her.</p>

<p>Then the long days of watching for his return
were lived over, and the one almost ecstatic moment
when he had leaped from the stage and over the wall,
with no one in sight, while he held her in his
arms.</p>

<p>And then&#8211;and this hurt the most&#8211;that last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
evening before they were to part again, when beside
the firefly-lit mill-pond he had the chance to say so
much, and said&#8211;nothing!</p>

<p>It was all a bitter-sweet memory, which she tried
to put away forever the night she left Greenvale.
She was now Vera Raymond. No one could trace
her; and yet, so at odds were her will and heart,
there still lingered the faint hope that Ray would
sometime and somehow find her out.</p>

<p>And so, studying faithfully, often lonesome, now
and then longing for the bygone days with Ray and
Old Cy, and always hoping that she might sometime
return to Peaceful Valley, Chip passed the winter
at Christmas Cove.</p>

<p>Something of success came to her through it all.
She reached and retained head positions in her
classes. A word of praise came occasionally from
Mr. Bell. Aunt Abby grew less austere and seemed
to have a little pride in her. She became acquainted
with other people and in touch with young folks, was
invited to parties and sleigh-rides. The vernacular
of Tim&#8217;s Place left her, and even Sundays were less
a torture, in fact, almost pleasant, for then she saw
most of the young folks she mingled with, and now
and then exchanged a bit of gossip.</p>

<p>Her own dress became of more interest to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
Aunt Abby, fortunately for Chip, felt desirous that
her ward should appear well, and Chip, thus educated
and polished in village life, to a degree, at least,
fulfilled Aunt Abby&#8217;s hopes.</p>

<p>Another success also came to her, for handsome
as she undeniably was, with her big, appealing
eyes, her splendid black hair, and well-rounded
form, the young men began to seek her. One
became persistent, and when spring had unlocked
the long, curved bay once more, Chip had become
almost a leader in the little circle of young
people.</p>

<p>Her life with those who had taken her in charge
also became more harmonious. In fact, something
of affection began to leaven it, for the reason that
never once had Aunt Abby questioned Chip as to
her past. Aunt Mandy and Uncle Jud had both
cautioned her as to its unwisdom, and she was broad
and charitable enough to let it remain a closed book
until such time as Chip was willing to open it; and
for this, more than all else that she received, Chip
felt grateful. But one day it came out&#8211;or at least
a portion of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have often wondered where I was
born, and who my parents were,&#8221; Chip said, one
Sunday afternoon, when she and Aunt Abby were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
alone, &#8220;and I want to thank you for never, never
asking.&#8221; And then, omitting much, she briefly outlined
her history.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born close to the wilderness,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and my mother died when I was about eight years
old. Then my father took me into the woods, where
I worked at a kind of a boarding house for lumbermen.
I ran away from that when I was about sixteen.
I had to; the reasons I don&#8217;t want to tell. I
found some people camping in the woods when I&#8217;d
been gone three days and &#8217;most starved. They felt
pity for me, I guess, and took care of me. I stayed
at their camp that summer, and then they fetched
me home with them and I was sent to school. Somebody
said something to me there, somebody who
hated me. She had been pestering me all the time,
and I ran away. Uncle Jud found me and took
care of me until you came, and that&#8217;s all I want to
tell. I could tell a lot more, but I don&#8217;t ever want
these people to find me or take me back where they
live, and that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t tell where I came from.
Then I felt I was so dependent on them&#8211;I was
twitted of it&#8211;that it&#8217;s another reason why I ran
away. I wouldn&#8217;t have stayed with Uncle Jud
more than over night except I had a chance to
work and earn my board.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>&#8220;But wasn&#8217;t it unkind of you&#8211;isn&#8217;t it now&#8211;not
to let these people know you are alive?&#8221; answered
Aunt Abby. &#8220;They were certainly good
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that they were,&#8221; returned Chip, somewhat
contritely; &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t stand being dependent
on them any longer. If they found where I
was, they&#8217;d come and fetch me back; and I&#8217;d feel so
ashamed I couldn&#8217;t look &#8217;em in the face. I&#8217;d rather
they&#8217;d think I was dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps it is best you do not,&#8221; returned
Aunt Abby, sighing; &#8220;but years of doubt, and not
knowing whether some one we care for is dead or
alive, are hard to bear. And now that you have
told me some of your history, I will tell you a lifelong
case of not knowing some one&#8217;s fate. Many
years ago my sister and myself, who were born here,
became acquainted with two young men, sailor boys
from Bayport, named Cyrus and Judson Walker.
Cyrus became attached to me and we were engaged
to marry. It never came to pass, however, for the
ship that Judson was captain of, with Cyrus as first
mate, foundered at sea. All hands took to the two
boats. The one Judson was in was picked up, but
the other was never heard of afterward. In due
time Judson and my sister Amanda married. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
gave up a sailor&#8217;s life, and they settled down where
they now live. I waited many years, vainly hoping
for my sweetheart&#8217;s return, and finally, realizing that
he must be dead, married Captain Bemis. That
all happened so long ago that I do not care to count
the years; and yet all through them has lingered
that pitiful thread of doubt and uncertainty, that
vain hope that somehow and someway Cyrus may
have escaped death and may return. I know it will
never happen. I know he is dead; and yet I cannot
put away that faint hope and quite believe it is
so, and never shall so long as I live. Now you have
left those who must have cared something for you
in much the same pitiful state of doubt, and it is not
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>For one moment something almost akin to horror
flashed over Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;And was he called&#8211;was he never&#8211;I mean
this brother, ever heard from?&#8221; she stammered,
recovering herself in time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; answered Aunt Abby, looking at her
curiously, &#8220;of course not. Why, what ails you?
You look as if you&#8217;d seen a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; returned Chip, now more composed;
&#8220;only the story and how strange it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>It ended the conversation, for Chip, so overwhelmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
by the flood of possibilities contained in
this story, dared not trust herself longer with Aunt
Abby, and soon escaped to her room.</p>

<p>And now circumstances came trooping upon her:
the shipwreck, which she had heard Old Cy describe
so often; the name she knew was really his; the
almost startling resemblance to Uncle Jud in speech,
ways, and opinions; and countless other proofs.
Surely it must be so. Surely Old Cy, of charming
memory, and Uncle Jud no less so, must be brothers,
and now it was in her power to&#8211;and then she
paused, shocked at the position she faced.</p>

<p>She was now known as Vera Raymond, and respected;
she had cut loose forever from the old
shame of an outlaw&#8217;s child; of a wretched drudge
at Tim&#8217;s Place; of being sold as a slave; and all
that now made her blush.</p>

<p>And then Ray!</p>

<p>Full well she knew now what must have been in
his heart that last evening and why he acted as
he did. Hannah had told her the bitter truth, as
she had since realized. Ray had been assured that
she was an outcast, and despicable in the sight of
Greenvale. He dared not say &#8220;I love you; be my
wife.&#8221; Instead, he had been hurried away to keep
them apart; and as all this dire flood of shame that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
had driven her from Greenvale surged in her heart,
the bitter tears came.</p>

<p>In calmer moments, and when the heart-hunger
controlled, she had hoped he might some day find
her and some day say, &#8220;I love you.&#8221; But now, so
soon, to make herself known, to tell who she was, to
admit to these new friends that she was Chip McGuire
with all that went with it, to have to face and
live down that shame, to admit that she had taken
Ray&#8217;s first name for her own&#8211;no, no, a thousand
times no!</p>

<p>But what of Old Cy and Uncle Jud, and their lifelong
separation?</p>

<p>Truly her footsteps had led her to a parting of the
ways, one sign-board lettered &#8220;Duty and Shame,&#8221;
the other a blank.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;Good luck comes now &#8217;n&#8217; then; bad luck drops &#8217;round
frequently.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> Old Cy emerged from the cave, his face
glorified and heart throbbing with the blessings now
his to give Chip, he looked about with almost fear.
The two abandoned canoes and the trusty rifle had
seemed an assurance of tragic import, and yet no
proof of this outlaw&#8217;s death. That this cave had
been his lair, could not be doubted; and so momentous
was this discovery, and so anxious was Old Cy
to rescue this fortune, that he trembled with a sudden
dread.</p>

<p>But no sign of human presence met his sweeping
look.</p>

<p>The lake still rippled and smiled in the sunlight.
Two deer, a buck and doe, were feeding on the rush-grown
shore just across, while at his feet that rusty
rifle still uttered its fatal message.</p>

<p>Once more Old Cy glanced all about, and then
entered the cave again. Here, in the dim light and
with trembling hands, he filled the cans once more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
and almost staggering, so faint was he from excitement,
he hurried to the canoe, and packing them in
its bow, covered the precious cargo with his blanket.</p>

<p>Then he ran like a deer back to the cave, closed
it with the slab, grasped his rifle, and not even looking
at the rusty one, bounded down the path to his
canoe again, launched it, and pushed off.</p>

<p>Never before had it seemed so frail a craft. And
now, as he swung its prow around toward the outlet,
a curious object met his eyes.</p>

<p>Far up the lake, and where no ripple concealed it,
lay what looked like a floating log, clasped by a
human arm.</p>

<p>What intuition led him hither, Old Cy never could
explain, for escape from the lake was now his sole
thought. And yet, with one sweep of his paddle, he
turned his canoe and sped across the lake. And
now, as he neared this object, it slowly outlined itself,
and he saw a grewsome sight,&#8211;two bloated corpses
grasping one another as if in a death grapple. One
had hair of bronze red, the other a hideously scarred
face with lips drawn and teeth exposed.</p>

<p>Hate, Horror, and Death personified.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did Old Cy glance at this
ghastly sight, and then he turned again and sped
back across the lake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>The bright sun still smiled calm and serene, the
morning breeze still kissed the blue water, the two
deer still watched him with curious eyes; but he
saw them not&#8211;only the winsome face and appealing
eyes of Chip as he last beheld them.</p>

<p>And now in the prow of his canoe lay her fortune,
her heritage, which was, after all, but scant return
for all the shame and stigma so far meted out
to her.</p>

<p>It was almost sunset ere Old Cy, his nerves still
quivering and wearied as never before, crossed the
little lake and breathed a sigh of heart-felt gratitude
as he drew his canoe out on the sandy shore near the
ice-house. No one was in sight, nor likely to be. A
thin column of smoke rising from the cabin showed
that the hermit was still on earth, and now for the
first time, Old Cy sat down and considered his plans
for the near future.</p>

<p>First and foremost, not a soul, not even his old
trusted companion here, not even Martin, or Angie,
and certainly not Ray, must learn what had now
come into his possession. Neither must his journey
to this far-off lake or aught he had learned there be
disclosed.</p>

<p>But how was he to escape from the woods and
these people, soon to arrive for their summer sojourn?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
And what if Chip herself should come? Two conclusions
forced themselves upon him now: first, he
must so conceal the fortune that none of these friends
even could suspect its presence; next, he must by
some pretext leave here as soon as Martin and his
party arrived, and cease not his watchful care until
Chip&#8217;s heritage was safe in some bank in her
name.</p>

<p>And now, with so much of his future moves decided
upon, he hurried to the cabin, greeted Amzi,
urged him to hasten supper, and, securing a shovel,
returned to his canoe.</p>

<p>In five minutes the cans of gold were buried deep
in the sand, not two feet from where the half-breed
had once landed, and upon Old Cy&#8217;s person the bills
found concealment. How much it all amounted to,
he had not even guessed, nor scarce thought. To
secure it and bear it safely away from this now
almost accursed lake had been his sole thought,
and must be until locks and bolts could guard
it better. That night Old Cy hardly slept a
moment.</p>

<p>And now began days of waiting and watching, the
slow course of which he had never before known.
He dared not leave the cabin except to fish close by
and within sight of the one focal point of his interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
Each midday, for not sooner would the expected
ones be apt to arrive, he began to watch the lake&#8217;s
outlet, and ceased not this vigil until darkness came.
A dozen times a day he covertly visited the ice-house
to be certain no alien footprints had been
stamped upon the sand near his buried treasure,
and had the hermit been an alert and normal man, he
must have noticed Old Cy&#8217;s strange conduct.</p>

<p>This burden of care also began to haunt his sleep,
and in it he saw the open cave, and himself watched
by vicious, leering faces. Once he saw those ghastly
corpses still clasped together, but hovering over him,
and then awoke with a sense of horror.</p>

<p>A worse dream than this came later, for in it he
saw the half-breed creeping along the lake&#8217;s shore,
and then, stooping where the gold was buried, he
began to dig, at which Old Cy sprang from his bed
in sudden terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go crazy if I don&#8217;t git rid o&#8217; that money &#8217;fore
long,&#8221; he said to himself; and the next day another
place of concealment occurred to him.</p>

<p>There was, beneath the new cabin, a small cellar
entered through a trap-door. It was some ten feet
square, and had been used to store potatoes, pork,
and the like. To carry out his new plan, which was
to hide the gold in this cellar, it became necessary to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
keep Amzi out of sight until its transfer was made.
That was an easy task, for Amzi, docile as a child,
was sent out on the lake to fish, and then Old Cy,
hastily constructing a bag of deerskin, hurried to
the beach, dug up the treasure, poured the glittering
coin into this bag, hid it in the cellar, nailed the trap-door
down, and that night slept better.</p>

<p>Two days after, just as the sun was nearing the
mountain top, Martin, Angie, Levi, and Ray entered
the lake.</p>

<p>How grateful both Old Cy and Amzi were for their
arrival, how eagerly they grasped hands with them at
the landing, and how like two boys Martin and Ray
behaved needs no description.</p>

<p>All that had happened in Greenvale was soon
told. Chip&#8217;s conduct and progress were related by
Angie. Ray&#8217;s plans to remain here another winter
were disclosed by him; and then, when the cheerful
party had gathered about the evening fire, Martin
touched upon another matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Hersey as we were coming in,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and he says that neither McGuire nor the half-breed
has been seen or heard of since early last fall.
Hersey came in early this spring with one of his
deputies; they visited a half-dozen lumber camps,
called twice at Tim&#8217;s Place, and even went over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
Pete&#8217;s cabin on the Fox Hole, but nowhere could they
learn anything of these two men. More than that, no
canoe was found at Pete&#8217;s hut, and there was no sign
of occupation at all this past winter. Nothing could
be learned from Tim, either, although not much was
expected from that source. It is all a most mysterious
disappearance, and the last that we can learn
of Pete was his arrival and departure from Tim&#8217;s
Place after we rescued Chip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think both on &#8217;em has concluded this section
was gittin&#8217; too warm for &#8217;em,&#8221; remarked Levi, &#8220;an&#8217;
they&#8217;ve lit out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good riddance if they have,&#8221; answered Old
Cy, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m sartin none on us&#8217;ll ever set eyes on
&#8217;em agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Old Cy spoke the truth, for none of this party
ever did. In fact, no human being, except himself
and Martin, ever learned the secret that this mountain-hid
lake could tell.</p>

<p>But another matter now began to interest Old Cy&#8211;how Ray and Chip stood in their mutual feelings.
That all was not as he wished, Old Cy soon guessed
from Ray&#8217;s face and actions, and he was not long
in verifying it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, how&#8217;d ye find the gal?&#8221; he said to Ray
when the chance came. &#8220;Was she glad to see ye?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; answered Ray, looking away, &#8220;she
appeared to be. I wasn&#8217;t in Greenvale but two
weeks, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw her &#8217;most every evenin&#8217; durin&#8217; that time, I
s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not every one,&#8221; returned Ray, vaguely;
&#8220;her school hadn&#8217;t closed when I got home, and she
studied nights, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Cy watched Ray&#8217;s face for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t pryin&#8217; into yer love matters,&#8221; he said at
last, &#8220;but as I&#8217;m on your side, I&#8217;d sorter like to know
how it&#8217;s progressin&#8217;. Wa&#8217;n&#8217;t thar nothin&#8217; said &#8217;tween
ye&#8211;no sort o&#8217; promise, &#8217;fore ye come &#8217;way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing of that sort,&#8221; answered Ray, looking
confused, &#8220;though we parted good friends, and she
sent her love to you. I&#8217;m afraid Chip don&#8217;t quite
like Greenvale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Cy made no answer, though a smothered
&#8220;hum, ha&#8221; escaped him at the disclosure of what he
feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish ye&#8217;d sorter clinched matters &#8217;fore ye left,&#8221;
he said, after a pause; &#8220;that is, if ye&#8217;re callatin&#8217; to
be here &#8217;nother winter. It&#8217;s &#8217;most too long to keep
a gal guessin&#8217;; &#8217;sides, &#8217;tain&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ray, however, made no defence, in fact, seemed
guilty and confused, so Old Cy said no more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>A few days later he made a proposal that astonished
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here now &#8217;bout two years,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; sorter oneasy. I callate ye kin
spare me a couple o&#8217; weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>No intimation of his real errand escaped him, and
so adroitly had he laid his plans and timed his movements,
that when his canoe was packed and he bade
them good-bye, no one suspected how valuable a
cargo it carried.</p>

<p>But Old Cy was more than &#8220;sorter oneasy,&#8221; for
the only spot where he dared close his eyes in sleep
during that three days&#8217; journey out of the wilderness
was in his canoe, with his head pillowed on that
precious gold.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>When</span> Old Cy joined the little party at the lake
again, he seemed to have aged years. His sunny
smile was gone. He looked weary, worn, and
disconsolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chip&#8217;s run away from Greenvale,&#8221; he said
simply, &#8220;an&#8217; nobody can find hide nor hair on her.
They&#8217;ve follered the roads for miles in every direction.
Nobody can be found that&#8217;s seen anybody
like her &#8217;n&#8217; they&#8217;ve even dragged the mill-pond.
She left a note chargin&#8217; it to that durn fool, Hannah,
and things she said, which I guess was true. I&#8217;d
like to duck her in the hoss-pond!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such news was like a bombshell in the camp,
or if not, what soon followed was, for after a few
days Old Cy made another announcement which
upset the entire party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d best go back to Greenvale,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;an&#8217; begin a sarch for that gal. I ain&#8217;t got
nobody in the world that needs me so much, or I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
them. I&#8217;m a sorter outcast myself, ez you folks
know. That little gal hez crept into my heart so,
I can&#8217;t take no more comfort here. Amzi don&#8217;t
need me so much as I need her, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ve made up
my mind I&#8217;ll start trampin&#8217; till I find her. I&#8217;ve
a notion, too, she&#8217;ll head for the wilderness ag&#8217;in,
&#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;m most sartin she&#8217;ll fetch up whar her mother
was buried. I watched that gal middlin&#8217; clus all
last summer. She&#8217;s true blue &#8217;n&#8217; good grit. She
won&#8217;t do no fool thing, like makin&#8217; &#8217;way with herself,
&#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ll find her somewhar arnin&#8217; her own
livin&#8217; if I live long &#8217;nuff. From the note she left,
I know that was in her mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin realized that there was no use in trying
to change Old Cy&#8217;s intent&#8211;in fact, had no heart
to do so, for he too felt much the same toward
Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you all the funds you need, old
friend,&#8221; he made answer, &#8220;and wish you Godspeed
on your mission. I&#8217;ll do more than that
even. I&#8217;ll pay some one to watch at Grindstone
for the next year, so if Chip reaches there, we
can learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night he held a consultation with his
wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect we are somewhat to blame for this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
unfortunate happening,&#8221; he said to her, &#8220;or, at
least, some thoughtless admissions you may have
made led up to it. It&#8217;s a matter we are responsible
for, or I feel so, anyway. I think as Old Cy does,
that this girl must be found if money can do it,
and I propose that we break camp and return to
Greenvale. If Amzi can&#8217;t be coaxed to go along,
I must leave Levi with him. No power on earth
can keep Old Cy here any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the old hermit had changed somewhat
since that night he broke away and returned to
this camp, and when the alternative of remaining
here alone, or going out with them all, was presented,
he soon yielded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Cyrus is goin&#8217;, I&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d
be lonesome without him.&#8221; And to this assertion
he adhered.</p>

<p>Ray, however, was the most dejected and unhappy
one now here, though fortunately Old Cy
was the only one who understood why, and he
kept silent.</p>

<p>Old Cy&#8217;s defection had influenced all alike, and
wood life was no longer attractive. It was a pity,
in a way, for no more charming spot than this
sequestered lake could be found. The trout leaping
or breaking its glassy surface night and morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
seemed to almost urge an angler; not an
hour in all the day but two to a dozen deer might
be seen along its shore, and blueberries were ripening
over in the &#8220;blow down.&#8221; Amzi&#8217;s garden,
now doubled in size, was well along, and it seemed
a sin to leave so many attractions.</p>

<p>But Martin had lost heart for these allurements.
The thought of poor, homeless Chip begging her
way somewhere, spoiled it all. Conscious that
her own neglect might have invited this calamity,
Angie was almost heart-broken, and it was a saddened
party that closed and barred the new cabin
and left this rippled lake one morning.</p>

<p>They were even more sad when Aunt Comfort
showed them Chip&#8217;s message, and Angie read it
with brimming eyes.</p>

<p>And now came Old Cy&#8217;s departure, on a quest
as hopeless as that of the Wandering Jew and as
pathetic as the Ancient Mariner&#8217;s.</p>

<p>But the climax was reached when Old Cy gave
Martin his parting message and charge:&#8211;&#8220;Here&#8217;s
a bank book,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that calls fer
&#8217;bout sixty thousand dollars. It&#8217;s the savin&#8217;s o&#8217;
McGuire, &#8217;n&#8217; belongs to Chip. I found the cave
whar &#8217;twas hid. I found McGuire &#8217;n&#8217; the half-breed,
both dead &#8217;n&#8217; floatin&#8217; in the lake clus by,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
an&#8217; &#8217;twas to keer fer this money I quit ye three
weeks ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I never come back here,&#8211;an&#8217; I never shall
&#8217;thout I find Chip,&#8211;keep it fer her. Sometime she
may show up. If ever she does, tell her Old Cy
did all he could fer her.&#8221;</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;Those who hev nothin&#8217; but a stiddy faith the Lord&#8217;ll provide,
never git fat.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Life</span> at Peaceful Valley and the home of Judson
Walker fell into its usual monotony after Chip&#8217;s
departure.</p>

<p>Each day Uncle Jud went about his chores and
his crop-gathering and watched the leaves grow
scarlet, then brown, and finally go eddying up and
down the valley, or heap themselves into every
nook and cranny for final sleep.</p>

<p>Existence had become something like this to
him, but he could no longer anticipate a vernal
budding forth as the leaves came, but only the
sear and autumn for himself, with the small and
sadly neglected churchyard at the Corners for its
ending.</p>

<p>Snow came and piled itself into fantastic drifts.
The stream&#8217;s summer chatter was hushed. The
cows, chickens, and his horse, with wood-cutting,
became his sole care. Once a week he journeyed
to the Corners for his weekly paper and Mandy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
errands, always hoping for a message from Chip.
Now and then one came, a little missive in angular
chirography, telling how she longed to return to
them, which they read and re-read by candlelight.</p>

<p>Somehow this strange wanderer, this unaccounted-for
waif, had crept into his life and love
as a flower would, and &#8220;Pattycake,&#8221; as he had
named her, with her appealing eyes and odd ways,
was never out of his thoughts.</p>

<p>And so the winter dragged its slow, chill course.
Spring finally unlocked the brook once more, the
apple and cherry blossoms came, the robins began
nest-building, and one day Uncle Jud returned
from the corner with a glad smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pattycake&#8217;s school&#8217;s goin&#8217; to close in a couple
o&#8217; weeks more, &#8217;n&#8217; then she&#8217;s comin&#8217; home,&#8221; he
announced, and Aunt Mandy, her face beaming,
made haste to wipe her &#8220;specs&#8221; and read the
joyous tidings.</p>

<p>For a few days Uncle Jud acted as if he had forgotten
something and knew not where to look for
it. He lingered about the house when he would
naturally be at work. He peered into one room
and then another, in an abstracted way, and finally
Aunt Mandy caught him in the keeping room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
with one curtain raised,&#8211;a thing unheard of,&#8211;seated
in one of the haircloth chairs and looking
around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mandy,&#8221; he said, as she entered, &#8220;do you
know, I think them picturs we&#8217;ve had hangin&#8217;
here nigh on to forty year is homely &#8217;nuff to stop
a horse, &#8217;n&#8217; they make me feel like I&#8217;d been to a
funeral. Thar&#8217;s that &#8216;Death Bed o' Dan'l Webster,&#8217;
an&#8217; &#8216;Death o' Montcalm,&#8217; &#8217;specially. I jest
can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em no longer, an&#8217; &#8216;The Father o&#8217; his
Country.&#8217; I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; tired o&#8217; that, &#8217;n&#8217; the smirk
he&#8217;s got on his face. I feel jest as though I&#8217;d
like to throw a stun at him this minute. You
may feel sot on them picturs, but I&#8217;d like to chuck
the hull kit &#8217;n&#8217; boodle into the cow shed. An&#8217;
them winder curtains,&#8221; he continued, looking
around, &#8220;things so blue they make me shiver,
an&#8217; this carpet with the figgers o&#8217; green and yaller
birds, it sorter stuns me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Pattycake&#8217;s comin&#8217; purty soon. She
must &#8217;a&#8217; seen more cheerful keepin&#8217; rooms&#8217;n ourn,
&#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;m callatin&#8217; we&#8217;d best rip this &#8217;un all up an&#8217;
fix it new. Then thar&#8217;s the front chamber&#8211;in
fact, both on &#8217;em&#8211;with the yaller spindle beds
&#8217;n&#8217; blue curtains, an&#8217; only a square of rag carpet
front o&#8217; the dressers. Say, Mandy,&#8221; he continued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
looking around once more, &#8220;how&#8217;d we ever happen
to git so many blue curtains?&#8221;</p>

<p>His discontent with their home now took shape
in vigorous action, and Aunt Mandy came to share
it. Trip after trip to the Riggsville store was made.
Two new chamber sets and rolls of carpeting
arrived at the station six miles away, and came
up the valley. A paper-hanger was engaged and
kept busy for ten days. The death-bed pictures
were literally kicked into the cow shed, and in
three weeks four rooms had been so reconstructed
and fitted anew that no one would recognize them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uncle Jud had utterly neglected
his &#8220;craps,&#8221; while he worked around the house.
The wide lawn had been clipped close. A new
picket fence, painted white, replaced the leaning,
zigzag one around the garden. Weeds and brush
disappeared, and only Aunt Mandy&#8217;s protest
saved the picturesque brown house from a coat
of paint.</p>

<p>And then &#8220;Pattycake&#8221; arrived.</p>

<p>Nearly a year before she had been brought here,
a weary, bedraggled, dusty, half-starved waif.
Now Uncle Jud met her at the station, his face
shining; Aunt Mandy clasped her close to her
portly person; and as Chip looked around and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
saw what had been done in her honor and to
make her welcome, her eyes filled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought anybody would care for me
like this,&#8221; she exclaimed, and then glancing at
Uncle Jud, her eyes alight, she threw her arms
about his neck and, for the first time, kissed him.</p>

<p>And never in all his life had he felt more amply
paid for anything he had done.</p>

<p>Then and there, Chip resolved to do something
that now lay in her power&#8211;to face shame
and humbled pride and all the sacrifice it meant
to her in the end, and reunite these two long-separated
brothers. But not now, no, not yet.</p>

<p>Before her lay two golden joyous summer months.
Aunt Abby was coming up later. She could
not face her own humiliation now. She must
wait until these happy days were past, then tell
her wretched story, not sparing herself one iota,
and then, if she must, go her way, an outcast into
the world once more.</p>

<p>How utterly wrong she was in this conclusion,
and how little she understood the broad charity
of Uncle Jud, need not be explained. She was
only a child as yet in all but stature. The one
most bitter sneer of malicious Hannah still rankled
and poisoned her common sense. Its effect upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
Chip had been as usual on her nature and belief,
and this waif of the wilderness, this gnome child,
must not be judged by ordinary standards. Like
reflections from grotesque mirrors, so had her
ideas of right and duty been distorted by eerie
influences and weird surroundings. There was
first the unspeakable brutality of her father; then
the menial years at Tim&#8217;s Place, with no more
consideration than a horse or pig received, her
only education being the uncanny teachings of
Old Tomah. Under this baleful tuition, coupled
with the ever present menace and mystery of a
vast wilderness, she passed from childhood into
womanhood, with the fixed belief that human
kind were no better than brutes; that the forest
was peopled by a nether world of spites, the shadowy
forms of both man and beast; and worse than
this, that all thought and action here must be the
selfish ones of personal gain and personal protection.
Like a dog forever expecting a blow, like
any dumb brute ever on guard against superior
force, so had Chip grown to maturity, a cringing,
helpless, almost hopeless creature, and yet one
whose inborn impulses and desires revolted at her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Once removed from these, however, and in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
purer atmosphere, she was like one born again.
Her past impressions still remained, her queer
belief of present and future conditions was still
a motive force, and the cringing, blow-expecting
nature was yet hers.</p>

<p>For this reason, and because this new world and
these new people were so unaccountable and quite
beyond her ken in tender influence and loving
care, what they had done and for what purpose
seemed all the more impressive. But it was in
no wise wasted; instead, it was like God-given sunshine
to a flower that has never known aught
except the chilling shadow of a dense forest.</p>

<p>And now ensued an almost pathetic play of
interest, for Chip set herself about the duty of
giving instead of obtaining pleasure.</p>

<p>She became what she was at Tim&#8217;s Place,&#8211;a
menial, so far as they would let her,&#8211;and from
early morning until bedtime, some step, some
duty, some kindly care for her benefactors, was
assumed by her. She worked and weeded in the
garden, she drove and milked the cows, she followed
Uncle Jud to the hay-field, insisting that
she must help, until at last he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like ye &#8217;round me all the time, girlie,&#8221; he
assured her, &#8220;for ye&#8217;re the best o&#8217; company, &#8217;n&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
I&#8217;d rather see yer face&#8217;n&#8217; any posy that ever grew.
But you&#8217;ve got to quit workin&#8217; so much in the
sun. &#8217;Twill get yer hands all calloused &#8217;n&#8217; face
freckled, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t have it. I want ye to injie
yourself, read books, pick flowers, &#8217;n&#8217; sit in the
shade. I see ye&#8217;ve got into the habit o&#8217; workin&#8217;,
which ain&#8217;t a bad &#8217;un, but thar ain&#8217;t no need on&#8217;t
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day a stranger happened up this valley,
so seldom travelled that its roadway ruts were
obscured by grass. Chip noticed him that morning
where the brook curved almost to the garden,
a fair-haired young man with jaunty straw hat,
delicate, shining rod, and new fish basket. He
was garbed in a spick-span brown linen suit. He
saw her also, looking over the garden wall, and
raising his hat gracefully, strode on.</p>

<p>His appearance, so neat and dainty and so like
pictures of fishermen in books, his courteous manner
of touching his hat, without a rude stare or
even a second glance at her, caught her attention,
and she watched him a few moments.</p>

<p>He did not look back until he had cast his line
into a few eddies some twenty rods away; and then
he turned, looked at her, the house, barns, garden, all
as one picture, and then continued up the brook.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>He was not seen again until almost twilight
by her, and then he and Uncle Jud entered the
sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Goodnow, Mandy,&#8221; Uncle Jud
explained, nodding to the newcomer and glancing
at Aunt Mandy and Chip. &#8220;He says he follered
the brook further up&#8217;n he figgered on. It&#8217;s four
miles to the Corners, &#8217;n&#8217; he wants us to keep him
over night. I &#8217;lowed we could, if you was willin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be most grateful if you kind ladies will
permit my intrusion,&#8221; the stranger added. &#8220;I
have been so captivated by this delightful brook
that I quite forgot where I was or the distance to
the village until I saw that the sun was setting. If
you can take care of me until morning, any payment
you will accept shall be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we can &#8217;commodate ye,&#8221; responded
Aunt Mandy, pleasantly. And so this modern Don
Juan found lodgement in the home of these people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an enthusiast on trout-catching,&#8221; he
explained, after all had gathered on the vine-enclosed
porch and he had presented Uncle Jud with
an excellent cigar. &#8220;About all I do summers
is to hunt for brooks. I came to the village below
here yesterday, having heard of this stream, and
never before have I found one quite so attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>Then followed a more or less fictitious account
of his own station and occupation in life, all very
plausible, entirely frank, and quite convincing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am unfortunate in one respect,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in
that I have no fixed occupation. My father, now
dead, was a prominent physician. I was educated
for the same profession and had just begun its
practice when he died. An uncle also left me a
large bequest at about the same time. My mother
insisted that I give up practice, and now I am an
enforced idler.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was such an entirely new specimen of manhood,
so charming of manner, so smooth of speech,
that Chip watched and listened while he talked
on and on, quite enthralled. She had seen similar
gentlemen pass and repass Tim&#8217;s Place, not quite
so dainty and suave, perhaps, but dressed much
the same. She had now and then noticed a pictured
reproduction of one in some magazine.
Insensibly, she compared this Mr. Goodnow with
Ray, to the latter&#8217;s discredit, and when the evening
was ended and she was alone in her room,
this new arrival&#8217;s delicately chiselled face, smiling
blue eyes, slightly curled mustache, and refined
manners followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a purty slick talker,&#8221; Uncle Jud admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
to his wife later on, &#8220;a sorter chinaware, pictur-book
feller &#8217;thout much harm in him. I kinder
felt sorry for him, so I &#8217;lowed we&#8217;d keep him over
night. Guess he ain&#8217;t much use in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>How little use and how much harm he was
capable of may be gleaned from a brief résumé of
this stranger&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>He was, as he stated, without occupation and
with plenty of money. He also, as stated, loved
trout brooks and wildwood life&#8211;not wildwood
life in its true sense, but the summer-day kind,
where, clad as he was, he could follow some
meadow brook or sit in the shade and watch it
while indulging in day-dreams and smoking. He
loved these things, but he loved fair ladies&#8211;collectively&#8211;still
more. He had stumbled upon
Peaceful Valley by accident, coming to it from a
fashionable resort to escape an intrigue with a
foolish <i>grande dame</i> and consequent irate husband.
Chip&#8217;s face and form had caught his eyes as he
strolled by that day, and admission to the home
of Uncle Jud and opportunity to meet, and, if possible,
impress this handsome country lass, had been
a matter of shrewd calculation with him. He
had purposely remained up the brook until nightfall.
He watched for and intercepted Uncle Jud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>
in the nick of time, persuaded that confiding man
that he was too tired to reach the village, and with
all the blandishments of speech at his command,
had obtained entry to this home.</p>

<p>But he failed to impress Chip as he had hoped.
She was no fool, if she had been reared at Tim&#8217;s
Place. A certain shiftiness in his eyes when he
looked at her, a covert, sideways glance, never
firm but ever elusive, was soon noted and awoke
her suspicion. Then the glib story he had told
of himself was soon contradicted by him in a few
minor details. Like all liars, he lacked a perfect
memory, and, talking freely, he occasionally crossed
his own tracks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, he also showed more
interest in her than in the brook the next day, and
the following one he capped the climax by asking
her to go fishing with him&#8211;an invitation which
she promptly refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that Mr. Goodnow,&#8221; she asserted
to Uncle Jud a little later. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s a deceitful
man. He pesters me every chance he can,
and I wish he&#8217;d go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was enough for Uncle Jud, and after supper
he harnessed his horse and politely but firmly
requested Mr. Goodnow&#8217;s company to the village.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span><a id='link_32'></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> many weeks now Chip had suffered from
a troubled conscience, and, like most of us, was
unable to face its consequences and admit her
sin.</p>

<p>Time and again she had planned how she could
best evade it and yet bring those two brothers
together without first confessing. Old Cy must
be told, of course. She could explain her conduct
to him. He would surely forgive her, she thought,
and then, maybe, find another home for her somehow
and somewhere. Oversensitive as she was,
to now confess her cowardly concealment and
her deception of those who had loved and trusted
her, seemed horrible.</p>

<p>But events were stronger than her will, for one
day in the last of August, Uncle Jud returned
from the village store, bringing dress materials
and startling information. &#8220;Cap&#8217;n Bemis is failin&#8217;
purty fast,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so Aunt Abby writes, an&#8217;
she ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; up here. It won&#8217;t make no difference
to you, girlie,&#8221; he continued, turning to Chip.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought home stuff to rig ye out fer school.
Miss Solon the dressmaker&#8217;s comin&#8217; to-morrer,
&#8217;n&#8217; we&#8217;ll take keer o&#8217; ye in good shape. We&#8217;ve
made up our minds ye belong to us fer good, me
&#8217;n&#8217; Mandy,&#8221; he added, smiling at Chip, &#8220;an&#8217; I
shall go with ye to Christmas Cove, if Cap&#8217;n Bemis
ain&#8217;t improvin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; find ye a boardin&#8217; place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awful sorry to hear &#8217;bout the Cap&#8217;n,&#8221;
interrupted Aunt Mandy, as if the other matter
and Chip&#8217;s future were settled definitely; &#8220;but if
he drops off, Aunt Abby must come here fer good.
I dunno but it&#8217;ll be a relief,&#8221; she added, looking
at Uncle Jud and sighing. &#8220;&#8217;Twa&#8217;n&#8217;t no love-match
in the first place, &#8217;n&#8217; Abby&#8217;s mind&#8217;s always
been sot on your brother Cyrus, &#8217;n&#8217; she never quite
gin up the idee he was alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now a sudden faintness came to Chip as
the chasm in her own life was thus opened. Only
one instant she faltered, and then her defiant courage
rose supreme and she took the plunge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your brother Cyrus isn&#8217;t dead, Uncle
Jud,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;he&#8217;s alive and I know him.
I&#8217;ve known it all summer and dare not tell because
I&#8217;m a miserable coward and couldn&#8217;t own up that
I lied to you. My name isn&#8217;t Raymond, it&#8217;s
McGuire; and my father was a murderer, and I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
nobody and fit for nobody. I know you&#8217;ll all
despise me now and I deserve it. I&#8217;m willing
to go away, though,&#8221; and the next instant she was
kneeling before Uncle Jud and sobbing.</p>

<p>It had all come in a brief torrent of pitiful confession
which few would be brave enough to make.</p>

<p>To Chip, seeing herself as she did, it meant
loss of love, home, respect, and all else she now
valued, and that she must become a homeless
wanderer once more.</p>

<p>But Uncle Jud thought otherwise, for now he
drew the sobbing girl into his lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit takin&#8217; on so, girlie,&#8221; he said, choking
back a lump; &#8220;why, we&#8217;ll all love ye ten times
more fer all this, an&#8217; ez fer bein&#8217; a nobody, ye&#8217;re
a blessed angel to us fer bringin&#8217; the news ye hev.&#8221;
And then he kissed her, while Aunt Mandy wiped
her eyes on her apron.</p>

<p>The shower, violent for a moment, was soon
over; for as Chip raised her wet eyes, a sunshiny
smile illumined Uncle Jud&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Cyrus is alive,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as ye callate,
I&#8217;ll thank God till I set eyes on him, and then I
think I&#8217;ll lick him fer not huntin&#8217; me up all these
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But mebbe he found Abby was married &#8217;n&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
didn&#8217;t want to,&#8221; interposed Aunt Mandy. &#8220;We
mustn&#8217;t judge him yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t judge him,&#8221; asserted Uncle Jud; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
jest cuff him, good &#8217;n&#8217; hard, an&#8217; let it go at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ez fer you, girlie, an&#8217; jest to set yer mind at
rest, we found out what your right name was and
where ye run away from last fall, but never let
on to nobody. &#8217;Twas your business and nobody
else&#8217;s, an&#8217; made no difference in our feelin&#8217;s, ez
ye must see; an&#8217; now I&#8217;ll tell ye how I found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was down to the Corners one day arter ye
went to Christmas Cove, &#8217;n&#8217; a feller&#8211;nice-lookin&#8217;
feller, too, with honest brown eyes&#8211;was askin&#8217;
if anybody had seen or heard o&#8217; a runaway girl
by the name o&#8217; McGuire. Said she&#8217;d run away
from Greenvale&#8211;&#8217;That&#8217;s &#8217;bout a hundred miles
from here,&#8217; he said&#8211;an&#8217; he was huntin&#8217; for her.
Nobody at the Corners knew about ye &#8217;n&#8217; I kept
still, believin&#8217; ye had reason fer not wantin&#8217; to be
found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now another tide&#8211;the thrill of love&#8211;surged
in Chip&#8217;s heart, and her face became glorified.</p>

<p>And so the clouds rolled away. That night
Chip wrote a brief but curious letter, so odd, in
fact, it must be quoted verbatim:&#8211;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/illus-325.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Quit takin&#8217; on so, girlie,&#8221; he said.
</p>
</div>

<div class='bq'>
<p class='sc'>Mr. Martin Frisbie,</p>

&#8220;Please send word at once to Mr. Cyrus Walker
that his brother Judson, who lives in Riggsville,
wants to see him. No one else must be told of this,
for it&#8217;s a secret.

<p class='tar sc'>&#8220;One who Knows.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>But Chip&#8217;s secret was a most transparent one,
for when this missive reached Martin three days
later, he recognized its angular penmanship and
similarity to the note Aunt Comfort still treasured,
and knew that Chip wrote it.</p>

<p>It startled him somewhat, however, for Old
Cy&#8217;s youthful history was unknown to him, and
suspecting that some mystery lay beneath this
information, he told no one, but started for Riggsville
at once.</p>

<p>The tide of emotion that had upset the even
tenor of Uncle Jud&#8217;s home life slowly ebbed away,
and a keen sense of expectancy took its place.</p>

<p>Chip, after giving him her letter, explained that
Old Cy was most likely in the wilderness, and
that the letter might not reach him for weeks.</p>

<p>And then one day a broad-shouldered, rather
commanding, and somewhat citified man drove up
to the home of Uncle Jud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>&#8220;Does Mr. Judson Walker live here?&#8221; he inquired
of Aunt Mandy, who met him at the door.</p>

<p>Her admission of that fact was scarce uttered
when there came a rustling of skirts, a &#8220;Why,
Mr. Frisbie!&#8221; and Chip was beside her, at which
Martin, collected man of the world that he was,
felt an unusual heart-throb of thankfulness.</p>

<p>A little later, when Uncle Jud had been summoned
into their newly furnished &#8220;keeping room,&#8221;
disclosures astonishing to all followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been searching for you, Chip, far and
near,&#8221; Martin assured them, &#8220;and Old Cy is still
at it. He left us at the camp, almost a year ago,
came to Greenvale, found you had run away, and
came back to tell us. It upset us all so that we
broke camp at once, taking Amzi with us, and
returned to Greenvale. Old Cy there bade us
good-bye and started to find you. Ray also began
a search as well. I&#8217;ve advertised in dozens of
papers, have kept Levi on watch for you at Grindstone
ever since, and now I hope you will return
with me to Greenvale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you all, oh, so much,&#8221; answered Chip,
scared a little at this proposal, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want
to. I&#8217;m nobody there and never can be. I&#8217;d be
ashamed to face folks there any more.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>&#8220;I guess she best stay with us,&#8221; put in Uncle
Jud, &#8220;fer we sorter &#8217;dopted her, &#8217;n&#8217; not meanin&#8217;
no disrespect to you folks, I callate she&#8217;ll be more
content here. I&#8217;d like ye to get word to Cyrus,
though, soon&#8217;s possible. I hain&#8217;t sot eyes on him
fer forty years, &#8217;n&#8217;,&#8221; his eyes twinkling, &#8220;I&#8217;m jest
spilin&#8217; to pull his hair &#8217;n&#8217; cuff him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will help out in that matter at once, and
more than gladly,&#8221; replied Martin, again looking
at Chip and noting how improved she was; &#8220;but
I still think Miss Runaway had better return with
me. We need you, Chip,&#8221; he continued earnestly,
&#8220;and so does some else I can name, more than
you imagine, I fancy, and my wife will welcome
you with open arms, you may be sure. As for
that foolish Hannah, she&#8217;s the most penitent person
in Greenvale. There&#8217;s another reason still,&#8221;
he added, glancing around with a smile, &#8220;and no
one is more glad of it than we all are. It&#8217;s a sixty-thousand-dollar
reason&#8211;your heritage, Miss Vera
McGuire, for your father is dead, and that amount is
now in the Riverton Savings Bank awaiting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin had expected this news to be overpowering,
and a &#8220;Good God!&#8221; from Uncle Jud, and
a gasping &#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; from Aunt Mandy,
proved that it was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span>Chip&#8217;s face, however, was a study. First she
grew pale, then flashed a scared glance from one
to another of the three who watched her, and then
almost did her shame and hatred of this vile parent
find expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he&#8211;no, I won&#8217;t say so, for he was
my father,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;but I want Old Cy
to have some of the money, and Uncle Jud here,
and you folks, all. I was a pauper long enough,&#8221;
and then, true to her instinct of how to escape from
trouble, she ran out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a curis gal,&#8221; asserted Uncle Jud, looking
after her as if feeling that she needed explanation,
&#8220;the most curis gal I ever saw. But we can&#8217;t let
her go, money or no money, Mr. Frisbie. I found
her one night upon top o&#8217; Bangall Hill. She was so
starved an&#8217; beat out from trampin&#8217; she couldn&#8217;t hardly
crawl up on to the wagon, &#8217;n&#8217; yet she said she wouldn&#8217;t
be helped &#8217;thout she could arn it. I think she&#8217;s
like folks we read about, who starve ruther&#8217;n beg.
But she kin have all we&#8217;ve got some day, an&#8217; we
jest can&#8217;t let her go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Martin, realizing its futility, made no further
protest.</p>

<p>Something of chagrin also came to him, for,
broad-minded as he was, he realized how partial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
neglect, the narrow religious prejudice of Greenvale,
and unwise notice of her childish ideas about
spites and Old Tomah&#8217;s superstitions had all conspired
to drive her away. She was honest and self-respecting,
&#8220;true blue,&#8221; as Old Cy had said, grateful
as a fawning dog for all that had been done for her,
and in spite of her origin, a circumstance that carried
no weight with Martin, she was one, he believed,
who would develop into splendid womanhood.
That she was well on her way toward that goal, her
improved speech and devotion to these new friends
gave ample evidence.</p>

<p>And now Ray&#8217;s position in this complex situation
occurred to Martin; for this young man&#8217;s interest
in Chip and almost heart-broken grief over her disappearance
had long since betrayed his attachment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you may have guessed that there was a
love-affair mixed up with this episode,&#8221; he said to
the two somewhat dazed people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I callated thar was, that fust night,&#8221; Uncle Jud
responded, his eyes twinkling again, &#8220;an&#8217; told
Mandy so. &#8217;Twas that more&#8217;n anything else kept
us from quizzin&#8217; the gal. I knowed by her face
she had heart trouble, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ve seen the cause on&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; exclaimed Martin, astonished in
turn, &#8220;for Heaven&#8217;s sake, where?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>&#8220;Oh, down to the Corners, &#8217;most a year ago, &#8217;n&#8217;
a likely boy he was, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And never told her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, why should I, thinkin&#8217; she&#8217;d run away
from him. We didn&#8217;t want to spile her plans. We
found out, though, her name was McGuire, but
never let on till she told us a spell ago.&#8221; And then
Uncle Jud told the story of Ray&#8217;s arrival in Riggsville
in search of Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow is my nephew, Raymond Stetson,&#8221;
rejoined Martin with pride, &#8220;he also is an orphan,
and I have adopted him. Chip has no cause to be
ashamed of his attachment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t callate she is,&#8221; replied Uncle Jud.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t that that jinerally makes a gal kick over
the traces. Mebbe &#8217;twas suthin some o&#8217; you folks
said.&#8221; And then a new light came to Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Walker,&#8221; he answered impressively, &#8220;in
every village there is always a meddlesome old
maid who invariably says things she&#8217;d better not,
and ours is no exception. In this case it was a
dependent of our family who took a dislike to Chip,
it seems, and her escapade was its outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye&#8217;ve got to hev charity for &#8217;em,&#8221; replied
Uncle Jud with a broad smile. &#8220;Never havin&#8217;
suffered the joys &#8217;n&#8217; sorrows o&#8217; love, they look at it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>
sorter criss-cross, an&#8217; mebbe this &#8217;un did. Old maids
are a good deal like cider&#8211;nat&#8217;raly turn into vinegar.
What wimmin need more&#8217;n all the rest is bein&#8217;
loved, &#8217;n&#8217; if they don&#8217;t get it, they sour up in time an&#8217;
ain&#8217;t no comfort to themselves nor nobody else.
Then ag&#8217;in, not havin&#8217; no man nor no babies to look
arter, they take to coddlin&#8217; cats &#8217;n&#8217; dogs &#8217;n&#8217; parrots,
which ain&#8217;t nat&#8217;ral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; continued Uncle Jud, &#8220;now that we&#8217;ve
turned another furrow, you&#8217;d best stop a day or
two with us, &#8217;n&#8217; sorter git &#8217;quainted. We&#8217;ll be
mighty glad to hev ye, me an&#8217; Mandy, an&#8217; then ag&#8217;in
thar&#8217;s a lot o&#8217; good trout holes up the brook. We
hev plenty to eat, &#8217;n&#8217; mebbe a few days here in
Peaceful Valley&#8217;ll sorter reconcile ye to leavin&#8217; the gal
with us.&#8221; And nothing loath, Martin accepted.</p>

<p>Aunt Mandy and Chip now bestirred themselves
as never before. The dressmaker was left to her
own resources, Martin and Uncle Jud rigged fish-poles
and started for the brook. Chip, with pail
in hand, hurried away to the fields, and when teatime
arrived, the big platter of crisp fried trout,
saucers filled with luscious blackberries, and ample
shortcake of the same with cream that poured in
clots, assured Martin that these people did indeed
have plenty to eat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>&#8220;How did this come to be named Peaceful Valley?&#8221;
he queried, when they had all gathered around
the table. &#8220;It&#8217;s very appropriate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; answered Uncle Jud, &#8220;we got it from a
feller that come up here paintin&#8217; picturs one summer,
an&#8217;,&#8221; chuckling, &#8220;&#8217;twas all we got for a month&#8217;s
board, at that. He was a sort o&#8217; skimpy critter,
with long hair, kinder pale, and chawed tobacco
stiddy. He &#8217;lowed his name was Grahame, that
he was in the show business &#8217;n&#8217; gittin&#8217; backgrounds,
as he called &#8217;em, fer show picturs. He roved up &#8217;n&#8217;
down the brook, puttin&#8217; rocks &#8217;n&#8217; trees &#8217;n&#8217; waterfalls
on paper, allus gittin&#8217; &#8217;round reg&#8217;lar &#8217;bout meal-time&#8211;must &#8217;a&#8217; gained twenty pounds while here. An&#8217;
then one mornin&#8217; he was missin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; so was Aunt
Mandy&#8217;s gold thimble &#8217;n&#8217; all her silver spoons. She&#8217;d
sorter took to him, too, he was that palaverin&#8217; in his
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>There now ensued a series a questions from Uncle
Jud in regard to Old Cy&#8211;how long Martin had
known him, and all that pertained to his history.</p>

<p>It was gladly recited by Martin, together with all
the strange happenings in the wilderness, the finding
of Chip, the half-breed&#8217;s pursuit and abduction of
her, and much else that has been told.</p>

<p>It was almost midnight ere Martin was shown to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>
the best front chamber, and even then he lay awake
an hour, listening to the steady prattle of a near-by
brook and thinking of all that had happened.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>A tone of regret crept into his voice, however,
when, after thanking Uncle Jud and Aunt Mandy,
and bidding them good-bye, he addressed Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could take you back with me,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;your return would be such a blessing to Aunt
Comfort and my wife. You may not believe it,
but you are dear to them both. I must insist that you
at least pay us a visit soon. Here is your bank book,&#8221;
he added, presenting it. &#8220;You are rich now, or at
least need never want, for which we are all grateful.
And what about Ray?&#8221; he added, pausing to watch
her. &#8220;What shall I say to him? Shall I tell him
to come and see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chip shook her head firmly. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;please don&#8217;t do that. Some day I may
feel different, but not now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span><a id='link_33'></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Sad</span> news arrived in Peaceful Valley a week later,
for Captain Bemis had passed on, Aunt Abby was
in lonely sorrow, and wrote for Chip to come at once.</p>

<p>Her fate was now linked with these people. Aunt
Abby had been kind and helpful, and Chip, more
than glad to return a little of the obligation, hurried
to Christmas Cove.</p>

<p>It was a solemn and silent house she now entered.
Aunt Abby, despite the fact that it was not a love-match,
mourned her departed companion. The
mill&#8217;s pertinent silence added gloom, and Chip&#8217;s
smiling face and affectionate interest was more than
welcome to Aunt Abby.</p>

<p>And now that concealment was no longer needed,
Chip hastened to tell her story in full.</p>

<p>How utterly Aunt Abby was astonished, how
breathlessly she listened to Chip&#8217;s recital, and how,
when the climax came and Chip assured her that
good Old Cy Walker was still alive, Aunt Abby collapsed
entirely, sobbing and thanking God all at
once, is but a sidelight on this tale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell you before,&#8221; Chip assured her,
while her own tears still flowed. &#8220;I was so ashamed
and guilty all in one, I couldn&#8217;t bear to. I never
did so mean a thing in all my life, and never will
again. But when Uncle Jud told me what you
didn&#8217;t, and how much he cared for me, and how
you once cared for Uncle Cy, I went all to pieces and
told the whole story and sent word to Uncle Cy that
day. I feel so guilty now, and so mean, I don&#8217;t
see how you can forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Aunt Abby&#8217;s forgiveness was not slow in
coming. The past ten days of sorrow had left her
heart very tender. In spite of being &#8220;book-larned,&#8221;
she was very humane. Chip&#8217;s sad life and misfortunes
appealed to her, as they had to Uncle Jud,
and true Christian woman that she was, her heart
opened to Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we shall never be parted while I live,&#8221;
she said, as the tears came again. &#8220;I have no children,
and no one to live for but my sister. I am so
wonted to Christmas Cove, I could not feel at home
anywhere else. If Uncle Jud will consent, I will
adopt you legally, and when I am laid away, all I
have shall be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Chip McGuire, waif of the wilderness,
child of an outlaw, once sold to a human brute, yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span>
fighting her way upward and onward to a better life,
despite every drawback, now found a home and
mother.</p>

<p>No light of education had illumined her pathway,
no Christian teaching and no home example, only
the inborn and God-given impulse of purity, self-respect,
and gratitude; and yet, like a bud forcing
its way up out of a muck heap and into the sunshine,
so Chip had emerged to win respect and love.</p>

<p>But all her history is not told yet. She still
lacked even a common education. There was still
an old man seeking to find her, who was yet wandering
afar. A homeless, almost friendless old man
was he, whose life had gone amiss, and whose sole
ambition was to do for her and find content in her
happiness. A wanderer and recluse for many years,
he was still more so now, and out of place as well
among the busy haunts of men. More than that,
he was an object of curiosity to all grown people
and the jest of the young, as he tramped up and down
the land in search of Chip.</p>

<p>And what a pitiful quest it was,&#8211;this asking the
same question thousands of times, this lingering in
towns to watch mill operatives file out, this peering
into stores and marts, to go on again, and repeat
it for months and months.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span>There was still another link in this chain,&#8211;a
boy, so far as experience goes, who was only
deterred from unwise haste by a cool-headed
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better not go to Chip now,&#8221; Martin
said to him on his return from Peaceful Valley.
&#8220;She is an odd child of nature, and you won&#8217;t lose
by waiting. My advice to you is to forget her for
the present, find some profitable occupation, and then,
when you have made a little advancement in life,
go and woo her if you can. To try it now is foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was cold comfort for Ray.</p>

<p>One of Chip&#8217;s first acts of emancipation was to
write to Aunt Comfort and Angie, assuring both of
her love and best wishes, and thanking them for all
they had done. Both letters were cramped in
chirography but correct in spelling, and in Angie&#8217;s
was a note for Martin, asking that he draw one
hundred dollars of her money and send it to her, and
as much more to pay some one to follow Old Cy.
The latter request Martin ignored, however, for he
had already set the machinery of newspaperdom at
work, and an advertisement for information of that
wanderer was flying far and wide.</p>

<p>Of the money sent her, Chip made odd and quite
characteristic uses, only one of which needs mention,&#8211;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>
purchase of a banjo. Had Ray known this,
and that the tender memory it invoked was the reason
for this investment, he would have had less cause for
grief. But Ray did not, which was all the better
for him.</p>

<p>And now, while she is in good company at Christmas
Cove, with Mr. Bell, syntax, decimal fractions,
the planetary system, and divisions of the earth
six hours of each school day, or with Aunt Abby
sewing, or picking at the banjo, or attending church,
we must leave Chip and follow Old Cy.</p>

<p>With a hunter&#8217;s instinct he had calculated that
Chip would head for the place of her birth, and then,
if possible, send word to either himself or the Indian.
That she had made way with herself he did not
consider probable. She was not of that fibre, he
felt positive; but instead, would make her own way
across country, working, if need be, to obtain food
and shelter until she at last reached the one spot
nearest her heart,&#8211;her mother&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p>Believing this of her, and judging rightly, he left
Greenvale, and, as it happened, twice crossed and
once followed the very route she had taken for miles.
That he failed to hear of her from the many he asked
was solely due to accident, added to her own caution
in avoiding all observant eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>And what an almost hopeless and interminable
tramp he took! Back and forth across the section
of country she was likely to follow for weeks and
weeks, halting a day in every village and two or three
in each city, asking the same question over and over
again, until his indomitable courage and almost
deathless faith slowly ebbed away.</p>

<p>Autumn came, the leaves grew scarlet and brown,
snow followed, and winter locked all streams, and
still Old Cy journeyed on. Spring and sunshine
once more warmed the earth into life, the fields grew
green, and yet he paused not.</p>

<p>With June and the real beginning of summer,
however, came a new inspiration, which was to go
at once by rail and stage to Chip&#8217;s native town and
learn if, perchance, she, or any news of her, had
reached this village.</p>

<p>Another thought also came with this,&#8211;that Martin
might soon again visit the woods and perhaps he
could intercept him.</p>

<p>A little satisfaction was obtained by this advance
move, for when this village was reached, Levi was
found waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watchin&#8217; for the gal over eight months
now, under pay from Mr. Frisbie,&#8221; he assured Old
Cy when they met. &#8220;I also sent word to Old Tomah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
late last fall, &#8217;n&#8217; he came out o&#8217; the woods &#8217;n&#8217; stayed
here two months, but nothin&#8217;s been heard o&#8217; poor
Chip by any one, &#8217;n&#8217; I doubt ever will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe not yet,&#8221; answered Old Cy, &#8220;but thar
will be some day, an&#8217; here, too. She hadn&#8217;t a cent
when she left Greenvale&#8211;only grit, &#8217;n&#8217; it&#8217;s a long
ways here fer a gal what&#8217;s got to arn her vittles
while she&#8217;s trampin&#8217;. It may be one year, it may be
two, but some day Chip&#8217;ll show up here, if she lives
to do it. I callate I&#8217;d best wait here a few weeks
tho&#8217;, an&#8217; then, if nothin&#8217; turns up, I&#8217;ll start ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing did, however; but during his stay, Old
Cy learned that Chip&#8217;s entire history, from the night
she left Tim&#8217;s Place until she ran away from Greenvale,
was known at this village. This fact was of no
value whatever, except to prove the universal interest
all humanity has in the fate and fortune of one
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never told what happened in the woods,&#8221;
Levi responded when Old Cy questioned him, &#8220;an&#8217;
didn&#8217;t need to, for it got here &#8217;fore I did. I jest
&#8217;lowed it was true, &#8217;n&#8217; that I was hired to wait and
watch here for Chip. It&#8217;s curis, too, how everybody
here feels &#8217;bout it. They&#8217;re a poorish sort here,
families o&#8217; lumbermen, men that work in the sawmills,
some farmin&#8217;, an&#8217; all findin&#8217; it hard work to git
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>
a livin&#8217;. An&#8217; yet they&#8217;re so interested in Chip &#8217;n&#8217;
so sorry for her, if she shows up now she&#8217;d be carried
&#8217;round the village like some queen &#8217;ud be, with everybody
follerin&#8217;. Thar&#8217;s &#8217;nother curis thing happened
since I&#8217;ve been here that I&#8217;d never believed o&#8217; these
people neither. I told them, of course, who I was,
&#8217;n&#8217; what I was here for, &#8217;n&#8217; who was payin&#8217; me,
when I come, an&#8217; then as time kinder went slow, I
began huntin&#8217; some &#8217;round here. Wal, thar&#8217;s a
little graveyard up back o&#8217; the village &#8217;n&#8217; all growed
up to weeds &#8217;n&#8217; bushes, an&#8217; one day last fall I happened
to be lookin&#8217; it over &#8217;n&#8217; somebody come &#8217;long.
It was a man that keeps store here, an&#8217; I asked him
if &#8217;twas here Chip&#8217;s mother was buried. He said
&#8217;twas, an&#8217; pointed out the spot &#8217;way up in one corner,
&#8217;thout any stone, &#8217;n&#8217; the mound most hid in a tangle.
I didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;&#8211;jest looked, an&#8217; went on, &#8217;n&#8217; that
was all. Wal, the curis part is last spring they sot
a couple o&#8217; men to work cleanin&#8217; up the graveyard
o&#8217; bushes an&#8217; laid out walks &#8217;n&#8217; built a new fence
&#8217;round it. That one unmarked grave got the most
attention o&#8217; all, for they turfed it over nice and built
a little fence &#8217;round it. I kinder callated how &#8217;n&#8217; why
it all come &#8217;bout, &#8217;n&#8217; feelin&#8217; I oughter do suthin, I
had a little stun sot up with Chip&#8217;s mother&#8217;s name
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>But time also went &#8220;kinder slow&#8221; for Old Cy, and
as the date for Martin&#8217;s probable coming had now
passed, he finally yielded to Levi&#8217;s suggestion and
the call of the wilderness as well, and the two started
for Martin&#8217;s camp.</p>

<p>It was almost like a pilgrimage to one&#8217;s boyhood
home; for while scarce a year had elapsed since Old
Cy and Martin&#8217;s party left it, Nature, always seeking
to hide human handiwork, had been busy, and
the garden was a tangle of weeds. Amzi&#8217;s old cabin
was almost hid by bushes, the walks were choked
with them, and a colony of squirrels frisked about,
and now, alarmed at human presence, added a
touch of pathos.</p>

<p>One act of vandalism was in evidence, for some
wandering trappers had apparently used the larger
cabin the previous season. Its floor was littered
with all manner of débris, the bones of a deer mouldered
in the woodshed, and a family of porcupines
had also found the premises available. The impression
conveyed by the entire spot and its surroundings
made even Levi gloomy, while Old Cy scarce spoke
the entire first day there, except to exclaim at &#8220;varmints&#8221;
who would break locks, use the cabin for
months, and then leave a litter of garbage to draw
vermin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s curis how near to hogs &#8217;n&#8217; hyenas a few
humans are,&#8221; he said as he looked around and saw
how these vandals had behaved. &#8220;They wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
satisfied with burglin&#8217; the cabin, turnin&#8217; it into a pig-pen,
stealin&#8217; all they could carry off, but they was
so durned lazy, they smashed up the furniture to
burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few days only these two fine old backwoodsmen
tarried here, and then Old Cy proposed departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take no comfort here, nohow,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;for the premises seem ha&#8217;nted. Whichever way
I turn I &#8217;spect to meet Amzi with his moon eyes, or
see Chip watchin&#8217; me, or Angie steppin&#8217; out o&#8217; the
cabin. If I stayed here long, I&#8217;d see Chip&#8217;s spites
crawlin&#8217; out o&#8217; the bushes soon ez it got dusky. I&#8217;m
used to the woods, but this spot seems like a graveyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never done no prayin&#8217;,&#8221; he added sadly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve in&#8217;t. But if I could set eyes on Chip
this minit, I&#8217;d go right down on my knees &#8217;n&#8217; say,
&#8217;Thank God for this blessin&#8217;.&#8217; I&#8217;m &#8217;fraid I never
will, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning these two friends left this abode
of unseen forms, more disconsolate than ever. They
halted at Tim&#8217;s Place long enough to learn that no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>
tidings of McGuire or the half-breed had even
reached that filthy station, and then returned to the
settlement once more. Here Old Cy waited until
the summer waned, vainly hoping each day would
at least bring some word from Martin or Chip, and
then bade Levi good-bye, and departed.</p>

<p>He had been gone a week, a wandering tramp
once more, when Ray appeared, bearing the glad
news that Chip had been found. And also another
and a more astounding fact.</p>

<p>But Old Cy was not there.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span><a id='link_34'></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Life</span>, always colorless at Christmas Cove, except
in midsummer, now became changed for Aunt
Abby. For all the years since her one girlish romance
had ended, she had been a patient helpmate
to a man she merely respected. Religion had been
her chief solace. The annual visit to her sister&#8217;s
gave the only relief to this motionless life, monotonous
as the tides sweeping in and out of the cove;
but now a counter-current slowly flowed into it.</p>

<p>Chip, of course, with her winsome eyes and grateful
ways, was its mainspring, and so checkered had
been her career and so humiliating all her past experiences,
that now, escaped from dependence and
feeling herself a valued companion, she tasted a new
and joyous life. So true was this, that hard lessons
at school, the regularity of church-going, and the
unvarying tenor of it all seemed less by comparison.</p>

<p>Another undercurrent, aside from Chip&#8217;s devotion,
also swept into Aunt Abby&#8217;s feelings,&#8211;the
strange emotions following the knowledge that her
former lover was still alive. For many years she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span>
had waited and hoped for this sailor boy&#8217;s return;
then her heart had grown silent, as hope slowly
ebbed, and then, almost forgetfulness&#8211;but not
quite, however, for the long, lily-dotted mill-pond
just above had now and then been visited by them.
A certain curiously grown oak which was secluded
near its upper end was once a trysting-place, and
even the old mill with its plashing wheel held
memories.</p>

<p>And now after forty years, during which she had
become gray-haired and slightly wrinkled, all these
memories returned like ghosts of long ago. No
word or hint of them fell from her lips, not even to
Chip, who was now nearest to her; and yet had that
girl been a mind-reader, she would have seen that
Aunt Abby&#8217;s persistent interest in all she had to tell
about Old Cy meant something. Where he was
now, how soon he would learn that his brother was
still alive after all these years, was the one most
pertinent subject oft discussed.</p>

<p>How Chip felt toward him, not alone for the
heritage he had secured for her, but for other and
more valued heart interests, need not be specified.
He had seemed almost a father to her at the lake.
He was the first of her new-found friends whose
feelings had warmed toward her, and Chip was now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>
mature enough to value these blessings at their true
worth.</p>

<p>A certain mutual expectancy now entered the
lives of Chip and Aunt Abby. Nothing could be
done, however. Old Cy had gone out into the wide,
wide world, as it were, searching for the little girl
he loved. No manner of reaching him seemed possible;
and yet, some day, he must learn what would
bring him to them as fast as steam could fetch him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that he loved me as his own child there
at the lake,&#8221; Chip said once in an exultant tone.
&#8220;His going after me proves it; and once he hears
where I am, he will hurry here, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether Aunt Abby&#8217;s heart responded to that
wish or not, she never disclosed.</p>

<p>But the days, weeks, and months swept by, and
Old Cy came not. Neither did any message come
to Chip from Greenvale. At first, rebelling at Ray&#8217;s
treatment of her, Chip felt that she never wanted
to see him again. She had been so tender and
loving toward him at the lake, had striven so hard
to learn and to be more like him, had waited and
watched, counting the days until his return, only
to be told what she could not forget and to find him
so neglectful, so cool to her, when her girlish heart
was so full of love, that her feelings had changed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>
almost in one instant, and pride had made her
bitter.</p>

<p>Hannah had told an unpleasant truth, as Chip
knew well enough; but truth and confiding love
mixed illy, and Ray&#8217;s conduct, leaving her as he did
with scarce a word or promise, was an episode that
had chilled and almost killed Chip&#8217;s budding affection.
As is always the case, such a feeling fades
and flares like all others. There would now be a
brief space when Chip hoped and longed for Ray&#8217;s
coming, and then days when no thought of him
came.</p>

<p>It was perhaps fortunate for him that Christmas
Cove contained no serious admirer of Chip the
while, else his cause and all memory of him would
have been swept away. But that quaint village was
peopled chiefly by old folk, those of the male persuasion
being quite young, with a few girls of Chip&#8217;s
age. Few young men remained there to make their
way, and so no added interest came to vary Chip&#8217;s
life.</p>

<p>The coming of summer, however, brought the
annual influx of city boarders once more. First
came elderly ladies, more anxious about suitable
rooms and food than aught else, and then came the
younger ones, whose gowns and their display appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
the only motive for existence. A few young
men followed in their wake. Now and then a small
yacht anchored in the mouth of the cove. The long
wharf became a rendezvous for promenaders, tennis
courts were established, and gay costumes, bright
parasols, and astounding hats were in evidence.</p>

<p>It was all a new and fascinating panorama for
Chip. Never before had she seen such butterflies
of fashion, who glanced at her and her more modest
raiment almost with scorn, and scarce conscious of
them, she looked on with awe and admiration.</p>

<p>The old mill, the quaint house where she dwelt,
and especially the long pond, now sprinkled thickly
with lilies, became a Mecca for these newcomers,
and not a pleasant day passed but from two to a
dozen of them came trooping about and around it.
They peered into the mill, exclaimed over the great
dripping wheel, and almost shouted at the sight of
the white blossoms on the pond.</p>

<p>One day a bevy of laughing and chattering girls
with one gallant in white flannels approached the
mill while Chip in calico was kneeling beside a
flower-bed. She looked up at once and saw her
erstwhile admirer at Peaceful Valley, Mr. Goodnow.
One instant only their eyes met, his to turn quickly
away, and then Chip, coloring at the slight, rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span>
and entered the house. Once safe in this asylum,
womanlike, she hastened to peep out at the arrivals.
They halted for only a glance about and then, their
protector (?) still in the lead, vanished behind the
mill.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, just as Chip was returning
from the village store, she met Mr. Goodnow again,
this time alone.</p>

<p>With a bow and smile he raised his hat and halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Raymond,&#8221; he exclaimed eagerly,
&#8220;I am so glad to meet you again. Are you visiting
here, and when did you leave Peaceful Valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am living here now,&#8221; returned Chip, coolly,
continuing on her way, &#8220;where you saw me yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered, not the least abashed,
&#8220;and you must pardon me for not recognizing you
then. It&#8217;s been a year, you know, since I saw you,
and you have changed so in that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; responded Chip, her eyes snapping,
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t remember me so long. Why don&#8217;t
you tell the truth and say you didn&#8217;t dare know me
before those ladies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Raymond, you wrong me; but I
admire your frankness&#8211;it is so unusual among
your charming sex!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span>&#8220;Then you did know me,&#8221; she returned sarcastically,
&#8220;I knew well enough, and if they were with
you now, you wouldn&#8217;t know me. I&#8217;m no fool, if I
do wear calico.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was blunt. It was truthful. It was Chip all
over; but this polished rake never winced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never dispute a lady,&#8221; he answered suavely;
&#8220;it doesn&#8217;t pay. Besides, I have found they all
prefer sweet lies instead of truth. And now I will
admit you looked so charming as you raised your
face from among the flowers that I was dazed and
didn&#8217;t think to bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t so dazed but that you managed to
get away in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course, I was piloting my friends up to
the lily pond,&#8221; he returned, still unruffled, &#8220;and
much as I desired, I couldn&#8217;t pause to visit with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now reached Chip&#8217;s home. She halted
at the gate, turned, and looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we may be friends, now that you have
scolded me enough,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I had a delightful
week with you last summer. I&#8217;ve lived it over
many times. May I not call here to-morrow, and
you and I will gather some of the lilies?&#8221;</p>

<p>A droll smile crept over Chip&#8217;s face at this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>&#8220;Yes, if you will bring your lady friends also,&#8221;
she answered. And with a &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and
raising his hat once more, this smooth-spoken fellow,
impervious to sarcasm, turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the young man?&#8221; Aunt Abby queried,
when Chip entered the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Mr. Goodnow, who spent a week with
Uncle Jud,&#8221; she answered, smiling. &#8220;He came by
here yesterday with three ladies and was close to me
when I was working in my posy bed. He made out
he didn&#8217;t remember me then, when I met him this
afternoon. I guess I was saucy to him. I meant
to be. He wouldn&#8217;t take it, and walked home with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Abby looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you weren&#8217;t really saucy,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;that wouldn&#8217;t have been becoming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Goodnow appeared next day, not at all disturbed,
and Chip, a little more gracious, consented
to gather lilies with him. The leaky punt that had
served for that purpose many years was bailed out.
He manned the oars. Chip bared one rounded arm,
and, thus equipped, two really enjoyable hours were
passed.</p>

<p>As Uncle Jud had said, he was a &#8220;slick talker.&#8221;
Truth was not considered by him; instead, subtile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
flatteries were his stock in trade, and Chip, for the
first time in her life, felt their insidious influence.
She was in no wise deceived. Her woman&#8217;s wit and
good sense detected the sham, and caring not one
whit for him, she responded as saucily as she chose.
It was not, perhaps, quite ladylike, but Chip was
not as yet a polished lady; instead, she was a decidedly
blunt-spoken girl who enjoyed exasperating
this fashionable Lothario.</p>

<p>And never before had he met her like or one so
fearless of speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the sauciest girl I have ever had the
pleasure of meeting,&#8221; he said, as they drew up to
the landing and began sorting the lilies. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
notice it so much last summer; and yet you are no
less charming, mainly because you are so frank.
Most ladies whom I know are not so. They are
arrant hypocrites and not one assertion in ten can
be taken at its face value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have been an apt scholar,&#8221; Chip
responded, smiling. &#8220;If you like my blunt speech,
as you say, why don&#8217;t you imitate it and be truthful
for once in your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not. No man ever yet won a woman&#8217;s
favor by plain speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you want my favor. What for? I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>
not of your sort. I do not spend my life playing
golf and tennis and wearing fine clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you ought to. You have the face and form
required, and once you got into the swim of society,
you would become a leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chip greeted this with a laugh. &#8220;Do you plaster
it on as thick as that with every one,&#8221; she queried,
&#8220;and will they stand it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;and almost beg for
more. My ladies thrive on flattery, and unless a
man doles it out to them, they think him stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had helped her out of the boat, holding
and pressing her hand unduly long she thought, he
gathered up the lilies and, with a graceful bow and
&#8220;Sweets to the sweet,&#8221; offered them to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them,&#8221; she answered bluntly.
&#8220;Take them to your arrant hypocrites and tell them
a girl you couldn&#8217;t fool sent &#8217;em.&#8221; And nonplussed
a little at this speech, but still smiling, he followed
Chip to the house. At the gate he halted and their
eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a most charming morning, for which
I thank you,&#8221; he said. And drawing two of the
largest blooms from the bunch of lilies, he laid the
rest on the gate-post. &#8220;You will have to take them,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;And now I have something else to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>
propose. I own a small yacht. It is anchored
down near the wharf. How would you like a sail
to-morrow? I shall be highly pleased to have you
for my guest. Will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip was not caught so easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go if you will ask Aunt Abby also,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;not otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; he responded graciously,
&#8220;that is understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>And still unruffled by this parting evidence of
distrust, he bowed himself away.</p>

</div>

<p><i>As</i> might be expected, Chip gave Aunt Abby a full
recital of her morning&#8217;s episode as soon as she entered
the house, and with it her comments upon this
smooth-spoken young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He reeled off flattery by the yard,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and no matter how I took it, or how sharply I set
him back, he kept at it. The way he piled it on
was almost funny, just as though he thought I believed
it. Of course I didn&#8217;t, not a word, and what&#8217;s
more I wouldn&#8217;t trust him farther than I could see
him. He&#8217;s got shifty eyes, and Cy once told me
never to believe a man with such eyes. He wants me
to go sailing with him to-morrow, and I said I would
go if you were asked. I knew you wouldn&#8217;t go,
however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; answered Aunt Abby, severely,
&#8220;and his asking you in such a way was almost an
insult. If he had meant well, he would have said
he was taking other friends out and would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359'></a>359</span>
asked us both to join them. I should not have consented
to that even, however. These summer
people are not our sort, and to accept such favors
from them is to put ourselves in a fair way of being
laughed at. I would advise, also, that you have no
more to say to this young man. It will not reflect
credit upon you if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon, while Chip practised upon her
banjo, it being vacation time, Aunt Abby called upon
several neighbors with news-gathering intent. She
succeeded to the fullest, and that evening related it
to Chip.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Mr. Goodnow has been here about two
weeks,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and is boarding at Captain
Perkins&#8217;s. He came in a small steam yacht he
claims he owns, and has been going about with three
ladies who are stopping at the Mix House. Two of
them are sisters, the Misses Wilson, and a Mrs.
Simpson, a widow. He seems the most devoted to
the widow. They have been out driving quite often,
and once or twice she has been sailing with him alone.
It&#8217;s all right, of course, only she being a good deal
older than he is, makes it seem curious. When he
calls here to-morrow, as I suppose he will, I&#8217;d better
see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He called quite early the next morning, as may be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>
guessed, and a more picture-book yachtsman Aunt
Abby never set eyes upon. His white duck shoes,
trousers, and cap, white flannel coat, dark blue silk
shirt, jaunty sailor tie and russet belt, all completed
an attire so spick and span that it seemed that he
must have just emerged from a tailor shop.</p>

<p>But Aunt Abby was not awed overmuch. She
had seen his like before, and met him at her door
with serene self-possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Goodnow,&#8221; he explained with easy
assurance, &#8220;and Miss Raymond has kindly consented
to accept a few hours&#8217; enjoyment in my yacht if you
will also honor me.&#8221; And he bowed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thank you very much, sir,&#8221; Aunt Abby responded
stiffly, &#8220;but I must decline for us both. We
should hardly care to accept hospitalities which we
could not return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret it very much,&#8221; he answered in a hurt
tone, &#8220;and assure you I am the one to feel obligated.&#8221;
And then, as Aunt Abby drew back, and the door
began to close very slowly, he bowed and retreated
in good order.</p>

<p>But he was not to be thus checkmated, and from
now on he began to watch for chances to intercept
and accost Chip.</p>

<p>It was, and always had been, a part of her nature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span>
to be out of doors as much as possible, and since the
close of school she was out more than ever. Somewhat
akin to Old Cy in love of Nature, the fields,
woods, and streams had always attracted her, and
at Christmas Cove the sea added a new charm to
which she yielded nearly every pleasant day. And
her steps led her far and wide.</p>

<p>Down to the seldom-used wharf to watch the tide
ebb and flow between its mussel-coated piles, over
the broad-rippled sands of the cove when the tide
left them bare, around to the long, rocky barrier
beyond the cove where the sea waves dashed, were
her favorite strolls.</p>

<p>The next afternoon she strayed to where the ocean
spray was leaping. She had scarce reached her
favorite lookout spot, a shaded cliff, when she saw
Goodnow approaching.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to return home at once, the
next to remain.</p>

<p>She did not fear him, he seemed such an effeminate,
foppish sort of man, that lithe and strong as
she was, she felt she could outrun him, or, if need
be, throw him into the sea. And so she waited, cool
and indifferent. Although conscious that he was
nearing her, she never turned her head until he was
beside her. Then she looked up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said, raising his hat,
&#8220;but may I share this cliff with you?&#8221; And he
seated himself near.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t mine,&#8221; answered Chip, rather ungraciously,
&#8220;so there&#8217;s no need to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But every lady has a right to decline a gentleman&#8217;s
company wherever she is,&#8221; he responded in
his usual suave tone. &#8220;I saw you coming here,
and I&#8217;ll admit I was bold enough to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what for?&#8221; she answered, in her blunt way,
&#8220;I never invited you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t, and I never expect you will.
But you are such a saucy, fascinating little wood-nymph
that I couldn&#8217;t help it. I am sorry, though,
that you and your worthy aunt refused my yacht
yesterday. I wanted an opportunity to get better
acquainted with her and yourself as well, and thought
that a good way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love the ocean,&#8221; he continued, as Chip
made no response, &#8220;and is this village your real home,
or do you reside at Peaceful Valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live here now,&#8221; returned Chip, resolving to be
brief in all her answers and hoping he would betake
himself away.</p>

<p>She did not like him, nor his smooth, polished
speech. She felt that it was all affected, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span>
at heart he meant no good toward her. Then his
failure to recognize her when with his lady friends
still rankled. She knew well enough that he dared
not admit acquaintance with a calico-clad country
girl at that moment. And what the gossips of
Christmas Cove insinuated about him and this
widow awoke her contempt.</p>

<p>Totally unused to the ways of fashionable society
as she was, for him to play court to a widow evidently
ten or fifteen years his senior seemed unnatural.</p>

<p>His almost nauseating and persistent flattery of
herself was equally objectionable. All this flashed
over her now while he was talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must find it lonesome here,&#8221; he said, in
response to her admission; &#8220;but perhaps you have
a beau, a sweetheart, somewhere, whom you care
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chip colored slightly, but made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you haven&#8217;t here,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;for
I&#8217;ve not seen an eligible fellow native to this village
since I came.&#8221; He paused a moment, awaiting
an admission, and then continued: &#8220;How do you
pass the time, anyway, and isn&#8217;t life here monotonous?
Don&#8217;t you long for some excitement, some
fun, some color to it all? I&#8217;ve watched these villagers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span>
now for three weeks and their lives seem so
prosy, so dead slow, it is painful. They get up, eat,
chase the cows and chickens, hoe in the gardens,
mow hay, and every blessed woman wears the same
calico gown six days in the week. Sundays they
all spruce up, go to meeting, and the next week
repeat the programme. Isn&#8217;t it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume it is,&#8221; answered Chip, with rising ire;
&#8220;but if folks here weren&#8217;t satisfied, they could move
away, couldn&#8217;t they? And if it&#8217;s all so dull, what
did you come here for? Nobody asked you, did
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he responded, laughing, &#8220;no one did, and
no one will miss me when I go&#8211;not even you. The
only redeeming feature is that they all seem willing
to take my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you stay if they weren&#8217;t,&#8221; she returned,
still more hotly, &#8220;would you sponge on us folks and
sneer at us as well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool, my dear girl,&#8221; he answered unruffled,
&#8220;keep cool, and let your lovely hair grow. I&#8217;m not
sneering at you or any one. I am merely stating
facts. To us who live in the whirl of city life, a few
weeks here is a delightful change, and we are glad to
pay well for it. I am only speaking of how it must
seem to live this way all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>He paused a moment, watching Chip&#8217;s face turned
half away, and then continued persuasively: &#8220;I
am sorry you are so ready to believe ill of me or to
think I am sneering at all things. In that you have
changed very much since last summer. Then you
seemed to enjoy talking with me; now you blaze up
into wrath at my pleasantry. I am very sorry you
feel as you do. I&#8217;d like to be better friends with
you if possible, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have risked
the rebuff I received from your excellent aunt yesterday.
I&#8217;d like very much to call on you, and
nothing would give me greater pleasure than to
entertain you and your aunt on my boat. I am an
idle fellow, I&#8217;ll admit, with nothing to do but spend
my time and money, but that is my misfortune,
and you ought to have pity on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so this smooth-tongued, persuasive talker
ran on and on while Chip, fascinated, in spite of her
dislike of him, listened.</p>

<p>More than that, he grew eloquent and even pathetic
at times in describing his hopes and ambitions
in life. He even asserted that he longed to live
differently and to become a useful man, instead of
an idle one. It was all hypocrisy, of course, but
Chip was scarce able to detect it, and lulled by his
specious, pleading voice, she admitted that she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>
no real reason for distrusting or disliking him. Also,
that she would enjoy a sail on his boat, and would
try to persuade her aunt to accept another invitation.</p>

<p>This especially was what he most wanted, for
shrewd schemer that he was, he knew that if he could
ingratiate himself with this guardian aunt, permission
to call must follow, and with that, some opportunity
to make a conquest of this simple country
girl.</p>

<p>Sated as he was with the society of more polished
and therefore artificial womanhood, <i>blasé</i> to all the
purities of life and refined society, a roué and rake
conversant with all vice, this fearless, wholesome,
yet unsophisticated girl who seemed like a breath
from the pine woods, attracted him as no other
could.</p>

<p>And now he had her almost spellbound on this
lonely shore, with the sea murmuring at their feet
and the cool winds whispering in the pine trees
shading them.</p>

<p>It was Don Juan and Haidee over again, only
this Juan was a more selfish and heartless one, calculating
on the ruin of this wood-born flower without
thought of consequences.</p>

<p>He made one mistake, however, after he had lulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span>
her into almost believing him to be both honest and
worthy,&#8211;he sneered at religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that people go to church for is to see and be
seen, ladies especially,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They live to
dress and show off their new gowns and hats, and
were it not for the chance church-going gives them,
not one parson in a hundred would have a
corporal&#8217;s guard for audience. As for the preaching,
not one in ten understands a word of it, and
most of those who understand fail to believe it. I
don&#8217;t, I am sure. I consider a minister is a man
who talks to earn his money. A few old tabbies,
of course, are sincere and believe in prayer and all
that sort of foolishness, but the rest only make
believe they do. There may be a God and maybe
there isn&#8217;t&#8211;I don&#8217;t know. I doubt it, however.
As for the hereafter, that is all moonshine. When
we go, that is the end of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you don&#8217;t believe in spirits and a future
life,&#8221; answered Chip, with sudden defiance. &#8220;Well,
I do, and I know that people have souls that live
again, for I&#8217;ve seen them, hundreds of times. As
for all church-going people being hypocrites, that&#8217;s
a lie, and I know better. The best woman I ever
knew believed in praying, and so did my mother,
and I won&#8217;t hear them called such a name.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span>It was Chip, blazing up again, in defence of her
own opinions, and this smooth-spoken fellow saw
his mistake on the instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you may be right,&#8221; he admitted at
once. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t speaking of all womankind&#8211;only
the fashionable ones whom I know. As for soul life,
I want to believe as you do, of course, and wish you
would convince me that it is true.&#8221; And so peace
was restored, and once more the lullaby of his wooing
talk began.</p>

<p>For two hours he spun to Chip the web of his
blandishments, and then the sun warned her, and
she rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be delightful to escort you home,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but I fear I&#8217;d better not. Your aunt might
see us returning, and scold you. Now if you will
meet me here again to-morrow afternoon, and try to
convince me that there is a future life, I shall be most
happy. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chip was alert.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think I shall,&#8221; she responded bluntly;
&#8220;I am not running after you&#8211;not a step. As for
what you believe or don&#8217;t believe, that isn&#8217;t my lookout,&#8221;
and with an almost uncivil &#8220;Good day, sir,&#8221;
she left him.</p>

<p>The farther away she got from this snakelike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span>
charmer, the more an intuitive belief in his real
intentions possessed her. She was unskilled in the
fine art of conversation, had only the inborn purity of
her thoughts to protect her; and yet she half read
this specious flatterer, and felt, rather than realized,
his baseness.</p>

<p>A change in her own convictions that now served
as a mantle of protection against his persuasions had
come to her during these dreamy hours by the sea.
Accepting at first Old Tomah&#8217;s superstitions, she
had been led to contemplate the great question of
future life and the existence of God. Aunt Comfort&#8217;s
unselfish character, combined with perfect
faith in the Supreme Power, had had its influence.
Angie&#8217;s kindness and that first prayer Chip had
heard in the tent were not lost. Aunt Abby&#8217;s consistent
belief and devotion to duty also had had its
effect; and all these pertinent examples, combined
with the impress of the vast ocean, the solitude
of this lonely shore, and the echo of its ceaseless
billows, had awakened true veneration in Chip&#8217;s
heart, and convinced her that some Unseen Power
moved all human impulse and controlled all human
destiny.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span><a id='link_36'></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>After</span> Chip had run away from Greenvale, concealment
of her name and all else had forced itself
upon her. It was not natural for her to deceive.
She had kept it up for one unhappy year only under
inward protest, which ended in abject confession and
tears. Now recalling that unpleasant episode, she
made haste to confess her long conversation with
this fluent fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Goodnow followed me over to the point this
afternoon,&#8221; she explained that evening to Aunt Abby,
&#8220;and talked for two hours. He was nice enough, but
he made me sick of him, he flattered me so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Abby looked at her with a slight sense of
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly has the gift of impudence, at least,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;in view of the way I declined his invitation
yesterday. I think you&#8217;d best discontinue your
long rambles for the present, or until he leaves here.
He is not our sort. He is not even a friend of ours,
and if people see you together, they will say unkind
things.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span>That was warning enough for Chip, and from that
time on she never even walked down to the village
store except with Aunt Abby.</p>

<p>A curious and almost ridiculous espionage followed,
however, for a week, and not a pleasant afternoon
passed but this fellow was noticed strolling
somewhere near the old mill or past the house.</p>

<p>Another amazing evidence of his intent was received
a few days later, in the shape of a five-pound
box of choicest candies, that came by express with
his card. Aunt Abby opened this and saw the card,
and the next day she commissioned the stage driver
to deliver the box, card and all, to Mr. Goodnow at
his boarding house.</p>

<p>A long and adroitly worded letter to Chip came a
day later, so humble, so flattering, and so importuning
that it made her laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that fellow must have gone crazy,&#8221; she
said, handing the letter to Aunt Abby, &#8220;he runs on
so about how he can&#8217;t sleep nights from thinking
about me. He says that he must go away next week,
and shall die if he can&#8217;t see me once more. What
ails him, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, except evil intentions,&#8221; responded Aunt
Abby, perusing the missive. &#8220;He must think you
a fool to believe such bosh,&#8221; she added severely, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>
finishing it. &#8220;Honest love doesn&#8217;t grow like a
mushroom in one night, and the difference between
his position and yours gives the lie to all he says. I
hope he will go away next week, and never come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether Chip&#8217;s studied avoidance of him, combined
with the snubbing, served its purpose, or he
decided his quest was hopeless, could only be guessed,
for he was seen no more near the mill, and the next
week his yacht left Christmas Cove, and Chip felt
relieved.</p>

<p>It had been an experience quite new to her, and,
in spite of its annoyance, somewhat exciting. It
also served another purpose of more value,&#8211;it recalled
Ray to her by sheer force of contrast. She
had felt hurt ever since the night she left Greenvale.
She had meant to put him out of her thoughts and
forget all the silly hours and promises at the lake;
and yet she never had succeeded. Instead, her
thoughts turned to him in spite of her pride.</p>

<p>And now, contrasting and comparing that honest,
manly lad, a playmate only, and yet a lover as well,
with this polished, fulsome, flattering, shifty-eyed
fop, who sneered at everything good, only made Ray,
with his far different ways, seem the more attractive.</p>

<p>Then conscience began to smite her. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span>
yielded to pride and put him away from her thoughts.
His uncle had almost pleaded for her to return to
Greenvale, if only for a visit. She knew Ray had
spent weeks in searching for her; yet not once in all
the two years since they parted had she sent him a
line of remembrance.</p>

<p>More mature now, Chip began to see her own
conduct as it was, and to realize that she had been
both ungrateful and heartless; but she could not
confess it to any one, not even Aunt Abby.</p>

<p>Chip&#8217;s life had been a strange, complex series of
moods of peculiar effect, and her conduct must be
judged accordingly.</p>

<p>First, the dense ignorance of years at Tim&#8217;s Place,
with its saving grace of disgust at such surroundings
and such a life. Then a few months with people so
different and so kind that it seemed an entrance into
heaven, to be followed by weeks of a growing realization
that she was a nobody, and an outcast unfit for
Greenvale.</p>

<p>And then came the climax of all this: the bitter
sneers of Hannah, Ray&#8217;s cool neglect, the consciousness
that she was only a dependent pauper, and then
her flight into the world and away from all that stung
her like so many whips.</p>

<p>But a revulsion of feeling was coming. Chip, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>
longer a simple child of the wilderness, was realizing
her own needs and her own nature. Something
broader and more satisfying than school life and the
companionship of Aunt Abby was needed; yet how
to find it never occurred to her.</p>

<p>With September came Aunt Abby&#8217;s annual visit
to Peaceful Valley. A few days before their departure,
Chip received a letter which was so unexpected
and so vital to her feelings that it must be
quoted.</p>

<p>It was dated at the little village of Grindstone,
directed to Vera McGuire, care of Judson Walker,
by whom it was forwarded to Christmas Cove.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>My dear Chip,</span>&#8221; it began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel that you will not care to hear from me, and
yet I must write. I know I am more to blame than
any one for the way you left Greenvale, and that you
must consider me a foolish boy, without much courage,
which I have been, and I realize it only too well
now, when it is too late. But I am more of a man
to-day, I hope, and sometime I shall come and try to
obtain your forgiveness for being so blind. No one
ever has been, and I know no one ever will be, what
you are to me. As Old Cy says, &#8216;Blessings brighten as
they vanish,&#8217; and now, after this long separation, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span>word and one smile from dear little Chip would seem
priceless to me, and I shall come and try to win it
before many months.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here with Uncle Martin&#8217;s old guide, Levi.
We are going into the woods to-morrow to gather
gum and trap until spring. I have hired two other
men to help, and hope to do well and make some
money. I think you will be glad to know that Old
Cy was here this summer and was well. He does not
know that you have been found, and is still hunting
for you. Levi told me that the people here are much
interested in you, that they have fixed up the yard
where your mother is buried, and he put up a small
stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could hear from you, but there is no
chance now. Please try to forgive a foolish boy for
being stupid, and think of me as you did during
those happy days by the lake.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<div class='bq'>
<p class='tar mr30 mb00'>&#8220;Good-bye,</p>
<p class='tar mt00'>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Ray</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>How every word of this half-boyish, half-manly
letter was read and re-read by Chip; how it woke
the old memories of the wilderness and of herself, a
ragged waif there; and how, somehow, in spite of
pride and anger, a little thrill of happiness crept into
her heart, needs no explanation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span>But she was not quite ready yet to forgive him,
and what he failed to say when he might, still rankled
in her feelings.</p>

<p>But Old Cy, that kindly soul, so like a father!
Almost did she feel that to meet him would be worth
more than to see any one else in the world. And
to think he was still hunting for her, far and near!</p>

<p>And now, quite unlike most young ladies, who
deem their love missives sacred, Chip showed hers
to Aunt Abby.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Raymond Stetson,&#8221; she said, rather
bashfully, &#8220;a boy who was in the woods with those
people who were kind to me, and we became very
good friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Abby smiled as she perused its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so he was the cause of your running away
from Greenvale,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you write
him a note of thanks after you learned he had been
searching for you? I think he deserved that much,
at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t humble myself,&#8221; Chip answered
spiritedly, &#8220;and then I was ashamed to let any one
know I had used his name. I hadn&#8217;t time to think
what name to give when Uncle Jud asked me, and
his was the first that came to mind,&#8221; she added
naïvely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span>Aunt Abby laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Master Stetson won&#8217;t find forgiveness
hard to earn,&#8221; she said, and then her face beamed at
the disclosure of a romance while she read the letter
a second time.</p>

<p>But there was more to tell, as Aunt Abby knew
full well, and now, bit by bit, she drew the story from
Chip, even to the admission of the tender scenes
between these two lovers, in which they promised to
love each other and be married.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was silly, I suppose,&#8221; Chip continued blushingly,
&#8220;but I didn&#8217;t know any better then, and I was
so happy that I didn&#8217;t think about it at all. I never
had a beau before, you see, and I guess I acted
foolishly. Old Cy used to help us, too, and took us
away so we could have a chance to hold hands and
act silly. I was so lonesome, too, for Ray all that
winter in Greenvale, and nobody knew it. I walked
a mile to meet the stage every night for a month, to
be the first to see him when he came. I guess he
must have thought he owned me. I wouldn&#8217;t do it
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Aunt Abby laughed, a good, hearty
laugh, and then, much to Chip&#8217;s astonishment, she
took her face in her hands and kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear little goose,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>
you ran away from a boy you cared for like that! I
only hope he is good enough for you, for I can see
what the outcome will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night when the tea-table had been cleared
and the lamp lit, Aunt Abby once more began her
adroit questioning of Chip; but this time it was of
Old Cy, and all about him. For an hour, Chip,
nothing loath, recited his praises, repeated his odd sayings,
described his looks and ways and portrayed
him as best she could, while Aunt Abby smiled
content.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel young again to hear your story
and about Cyrus,&#8221; she said when all was told. &#8220;I
was just sixteen when he first came to see me. He
was also my first beau, you know. I should judge
he must have changed so I would never know him,
and maybe he wouldn&#8217;t recognize me. Forty years
is a long time!&#8221; And she sighed.</p>

<p>And now Aunt Abby closed her eyes, let fall her
knitting, and lapsed into bygones.</p>

<p>No longer was she a staid and matronly widow&#8211;not
young, it is true, yet not old, but with rounded
face, few wrinkles, and slightly gray hair. Instead
was she sweet Abby Grey of the long ago, and once
more the belle of this quiet village and Bayport, and
the leader at every dance, every husking, and every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span>
party. Once more she primped and curled her hair,
and donned her best, and waited her sailor boy&#8217;s
coming. Once more she heard the bells jingle and
saw the stars twinkle as they sped away to a winter
night&#8217;s dance&#8211;and once more she felt the sorrow
of parting, the long years of waiting, waiting, waiting,
and at last the numb despair and final conviction
that never would her lover return.</p>

<p>And now he was still alive, though a wanderer,
and some day he might&#8211;surely would come to see
her, just once, if no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, me,&#8221; she said, rousing herself at last and
looking at Chip&#8217;s smiling, sunny face, &#8220;life is a queer
riddle, and we never know how to guess it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she sighed again.</p>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;The milk o&#8217; human kindness &#8217;most allus turns out old
cheese, &#8217;n&#8217; all rind at that.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Some</span> sneering critic once said that few young men
ever start out in the world until they are kicked out,
and there is a grain of truth in that assertion. It is
seldom an actual kick, however, but some motive
force quite as compelling.</p>

<p>In Ray&#8217;s case it was his uncle&#8217;s assertion that if
he hoped to win Chip he must first show the ability
to provide a home for her, which is excellent advice
for any young man to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be a pleasure trip,&#8221; Martin said when
Ray proposed to go to the wilderness and, with Levi
and a couple of other assistants, make a business of
gum-gathering and trap-setting, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t lose
much by it. You are welcome to the camp; Levi
will see that you have game enough to eat, and boss
the expedition. I will loan you five hundred, and
with what you have, that is capital enough and you
ought to do well. It would be better if Old Cy could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span>
take charge, but as it is, you must go it alone.&#8221; And
go it alone Ray did.</p>

<p>Levi&#8217;s services were easily secured. Two young
fellows whom he knew were hired at Greenvale.
A bateau was purchased, together with more traps
and supplies, and after Ray had written Chip his
plan, the party started for Martin&#8217;s camp. They
had been established there a month and were doing
well. The first ice had begun forming in shallow
coves when one afternoon, who should enter the lake
and paddle rapidly across but Old Cy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye can&#8217;t git rid o&#8217; me when trappin&#8217;s goin&#8217; on,&#8221;
he said cheerily, as Ray and Levi met him at the
landing. &#8220;I fetched into the settlement kinder
homesick fer the woods last week. I heard the good
news &#8217;bout Chip&#8217;s bein&#8217; found &#8217;n&#8217; you&#8217;d come here
fer the winter, &#8217;n&#8217; I didn&#8217;t wait a minute &#8217;fore I hired
a canoe &#8217;n&#8217; started.&#8221; And then, in the exuberance
of his joy, he shook hands with Ray and Levi once
more.</p>

<p>That evening, Ray, who had hard work to keep
the secret so long, told Old Cy who lived in Peaceful
Valley.</p>

<p>It was like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, a shock
of joyful news that made Old Cy gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I feel jest like a colt once more,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span>
after the exclamation stage had passed. &#8220;An&#8217;, do
ye know, boys, I felt all the way comin&#8217; in ez though
good news was waitin&#8217; fer me. I &#8217;spose &#8217;twas from
hearin&#8217; Chip was all right ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening was one that none who were in that
wildwood camp ever forgot, for Old Cy was the central
figure, and told as only he could the story of his
year&#8217;s wandering in search of Chip.</p>

<p>It was humorous, pathetic, and tragic all in one,
and a tale that held its listeners spellbound for three
delightful hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had dogs set on me, hundreds on &#8217;em,&#8221; Old
Cy said, in conclusion, &#8220;an&#8217; I never knew afore how
many kinds &#8217;n&#8217; sizes o&#8217; dogs thar was in this world.
I uster think thar warn&#8217;t more&#8217;n two dozen or so
kinds. I know now thar&#8217;s two million &#8217;n&#8217; a few
more I didn&#8217;t wait to count. I got &#8217;rested a few
times on account o&#8217; not havin&#8217; visible means o&#8217; support.
I&#8217;ve been hauled over the coals by doctors
tryin&#8217; to make me out a lunatic, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; done time
in jail if I hadn&#8217;t had money to show. I tell ye, boys,
this is an awful &#8217;spicious world fer strangers, &#8217;n&#8217; the
milk o&#8217; human kindness is mostly old cheese, &#8217;n&#8217; all
rind at that. I had a little fun, too, mixed in with
all the trouble, &#8217;n&#8217; one woman who owned a place
where I &#8217;plied for lodgin&#8217; jest &#8217;bout told me she&#8217;d be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>
willin&#8217; to marry me if I&#8217;d stay &#8217;n&#8217; work the farm. She
had red hair, hard eyes, &#8217;n&#8217; bossy sort o&#8217; ways, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s a dangerous combination. I watched my
chance when she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; lit out middlin&#8217;
lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now life at this wilderness camp, less restrained
than when womankind were here, became
one of work, and persistent, steady, no-time-wasted
work at that. Martin had said that Levi could boss
matters, but it was Ray who assumed management
instead. Two years had changed him almost from
boy to man. His new ambition was the controlling
power. He was here to make his mark, as it were,
and the half-hearted, boyish interest in work had
changed into a tireless leadership. Then, too, an
unspoken, tacit interest in his ambition was felt by
those who helped. They knew what he was striving
for, and that Chip was the ultimate object. Her
history, known as it now was to all who came into
the wilderness, influenced these woodsmen. She
had been of them and from them, and as an entire
village will gather to help at a house-raising, so these
three, Levi and the two helpers, now felt the same
incentive.</p>

<p>Success usually comes to all who strive for it, and
now, with four willing workers to aid him, Ray was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>
rapidly making a success of this venture. Old Cy,
the most valuable assistant, was indefatigable. He
not only kept the larder well supplied with game,
but tended and set traps, worked in the woods with
the rest between times, and his cheerful optimism
and droll humor bridged many a stormy day and
shortened many a weary tramp. And he seemed to
grow younger in this new, helpful life for others.
His eyes were bright, his step elastic, his spirits
buoyant, his strength tireless.</p>

<p>With Chip safe and provided for, with Ray succeeding
in manhood&#8217;s natural ambition, Old Cy
saw his heart&#8217;s best hopes nearing fruition, and for
these two and in these two all his interest centred.</p>

<p>Only once was the bond of feeling between Ray
and Chip referred to by Old Cy, and then in response
to a wish of Ray&#8217;s that he might hear from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think ye&#8217;ve cause to worry now, arter
ye&#8217;ve sent her word what ye&#8217;re doin&#8217; &#8217;n&#8217; who for,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Chip&#8217;s true blue, not one o&#8217; the
fickle sort, &#8217;n&#8217; once she keers fer a man, she won&#8217;t
give him up till he&#8217;s married or dead. I think ye&#8217;d
orter sent her word sooner,&#8211;ye know she run &#8217;way
out o&#8217; spunk,&#8211;but when ye go to her like a man &#8217;n&#8217;
say, &#8216;I've been workin' 'n' waitin' fer ye all the time,&#8217;
thar won&#8217;t be no quarrellin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385'></a>385</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that,&#8221; responded Ray,
soberly. &#8220;From what Uncle Martin said, my
chance is gone with Miss Chip, and I don&#8217;t blame
her for feeling so. Like every young fellow, I
took it for granted that she was in love with me
and ready to fall into my arms on call. Then I
hadn&#8217;t any plans in life, anyway, and, like a fool,
believed it made no difference to her. To mix
matters up still more, Hannah crowded herself
into our affairs and said things to Chip, with the
result that Chip got mad, ran away, and you know
the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; asserted Old Cy, his eyes twinkling,
&#8220;the time to hug a gal is when she&#8217;s willin&#8217;, &#8217;n&#8217; ye
orter spunked up that night &#8217;fore ye come away
&#8217;n&#8217; told her ye was callatin&#8217; to make yer fortin in
the woods, an&#8217; that ye wanted her to wait &#8217;n&#8217; share
it&#8211;then hugged &#8217;n&#8217; kissed her a little more by
way o&#8217; bindin&#8217; the bargain, an&#8217;&#8211;knowin&#8217; that gal
ez I do, she&#8217;d fought Hannah, tooth &#8217;n&#8217; nail, &#8217;n&#8217;
walked through fire &#8217;n&#8217; brimstun fer ye. I
think, &#8217;stead o&#8217; hidin&#8217; herself fer two years, an&#8217;
changin&#8217; her name, she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; tramped clear to Grindstun
jest to tell ye her troubles, &#8217;n&#8217;, if need be, she&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; starved fer ye. I tell ye, boy, wimmin like
her is scarce in this world, &#8217;n&#8217; when ye find one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386'></a>386</span>
young &#8217;n&#8217; pretty ez she is, hang on to her an&#8217; hang
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it now well enough,&#8221; returned Ray,
ruefully; &#8220;but that don&#8217;t help matters. Then that
fortune you found for her makes my case all the
worse, and Chip quite independent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It do, it do,&#8221; chuckled Old Cy, as if glad of
it, &#8220;an&#8217; all the more need o&#8217; you hustlin&#8217;. It&#8217;s a
case o&#8217; woodchuck with ye now. But don&#8217;t git
discouraged. Jest dig. Chip&#8217;s worth it, ten times
over, &#8217;n&#8217; no man ever worked to win a woman &#8217;thout
bein&#8217; bettered by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was terse and homely advice, and not only
convinced Ray that he had neglected one whom he
now felt meant home, wife, happiness, and all
that life might mean for him, but made him realize
that all possible striving and self-denial must
be made in atonement. With whom and what
sort of people Chip had found asylum, he knew
not. What influence they would have upon her
feelings was an equally unknown matter; and
worse than that, the ogre of another suitor for
Chip&#8217;s favor now entered Ray&#8217;s calculations, and
the slang truism, &#8220;There are others,&#8221; was with
him every waking moment&#8211;a much-deserved
punishment, all womankind will say.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387'></a>387</span><a id='link_38'></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>One</span> day while Aunt Abby and Chip were enjoying
the newly furnished home of Uncle Jud, a capacious
carriage drawn by a handsome pair of horses
halted there and Martin and Angie alighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are taking a cross-country drive for an
outing,&#8221; he explained, after Angie had kissed
Chip tenderly and greetings had been exchanged.
&#8220;We have waited for you, Miss Runaway, to
come and visit us,&#8221; he added, turning to Chip,
&#8220;until we couldn&#8217;t wait any longer and so came to
look for you. We have also some news that may
interest you. Old Cy has been heard from at
last. He spent a year looking for you. He has
now gone into the woods, to my camp, where Ray
located for the winter, and when spring comes, I
can guess where they will head for.&#8221;</p>

<p>How welcome this news was to Chip, her face
fully indicated; but neither Martin nor Angie
realized how much or for what reason it interested
this soft-voiced, gracious lady whom Chip called
Aunt Abby. They knew Uncle Jud was Old Cy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388'></a>388</span>
brother and that they had once been sailors from
Bayport, but the long-ago romance of Aunt Abby&#8217;s
life was unknown to them.</p>

<p>And now ensued a welcome to the callers such
as only Uncle Jud and Aunt Mandy could offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sorter feel we robbed ye o&#8217; Vera,&#8221; Uncle
Jud explained, &#8220;though &#8217;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t any intention on
our part, an&#8217; so ye must gin us some chance to
make amends. We callate &#8217;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t no fault of
yourn, either, only one o&#8217; them happenin&#8217;s that
was luck for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening was one long to be remembered
by all who were present, for Chip&#8217;s history, as
told by Martin and Angie, was the entertaining
topic, and its humorous side was made the most
of by Martin. Chip was in no wise annoyed by
Martin&#8217;s fun-making, either. Instead, conscious
of the good-will and affection of the friends who
had rescued her from the wilderness, she rather
enjoyed it and laughed heartily at Martin&#8217;s description
of various incidents, especially her first
appearance in their camp, and the language she
used.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help swearing,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I
never had heard much except &#8217;cuss&#8217; words. I
think also now, as I recall my life at Tim&#8217;s Place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389'></a>389</span>
I would never have dared that desperate mode of
escape had I not been hardened by such a life.
I wish I could see Old Tomah once more,&#8221; she
added musingly, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like to send him some
gift. He was the best-hearted Indian I ever saw
or heard of, and his queer teachings about spites
and how they rewarded us for good deeds and
punished us for evil ones was no harm, for it set
me thinking. The one thought that encouraged
me most during those awful days and nights alone
in the woods was the belief that among the spites
which I was sure followed me was my mother&#8217;s
soul. I&#8217;ve never changed in my belief, either,
and shall always feel that she guided me to your
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Jud also obtained his share of fun at
Chip&#8217;s expense, describing his finding of her with
humorous additions.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was all beat out that night I found her
on top o&#8217; Bangall Hill, &#8217;n&#8217; yet when I asked her if
she&#8217;d run away from some poor farm, she was
ready to claw my eyes out, an&#8217; dunno&#8217;s I blame
her. I was innocent, too, fer I really s&#8217;posed she
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s visit at this hospitable home was not
allowed to terminate for a week, for visitors seldom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390'></a>390</span>
came here, and Uncle Jud, as big a boy as
his brother when the chance came, planned all
sorts of trips and outings to entertain them, and
quite characteristic affairs they were, too.</p>

<p>One day they drove to a wood-bordered pond
far up the valley, fished a few hours for pickerel
and perch, and had a fish fry and picnic dinner.</p>

<p>The next day they visited a strange, romantic
grotto up in the mountains, known as the Wolf&#8217;s
Den, and here a table was set, broiled chicken,
sweet corn, and such toothsome fare formed the
meal, with nut-gathering for amusement.</p>

<p>Squirrel and partridge shooting also furnished
Martin a little excitement. When he and Angie
insisted that they must leave, both host and hostess
showed genuine regret. A few remarks made by
Angie to her former protégée, in private, the last
evening of this visit, may be quoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must insist, my dear child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
you make us a visit in the near future. You left
us under an entirely false impression and it has
grieved me more than you can imagine. There
was never a word of truth in anything that Hannah
said. She was spiteful and malicious and desired
to get even with you for a hurt to her pride. We
had no thought of hurrying away to the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391'></a>391</span>
to separate you and Ray for any reason whatever.
Of course, as you must know, I had no suspicion
of any attachment between you, and if I had, I
certainly should not have tried to break it off in
that way. That is a matter that concerns only
you and him. My own life experience shows that
first love is the wisest and best, and while you were
both too young then for an engagement, you must
believe me when I tell you that I had no wish to
interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the breach was healed.</p>

<p>This visit of the Frisbies to Peaceful Valley
also awakened something of repentance in Chip&#8217;s
mind, and more mature now, it occurred to her
that leaving Greenvale as she did, was, after all,
childish.</p>

<p>Then Angie&#8217;s part in this drama of her life now
returned to Chip in a new light. Once she began
to reflect, her self-accusation grew apace and her
repentance as well. Now she began to see herself
as she was at Tim&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I treated my Greenvale friends very
ungratefully,&#8221; she said to Aunt Abby one evening
after they had returned to Christmas Cove once
more, &#8220;and what Mrs. Frisbie said to me has
made me realize it. I know now that few would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392'></a>392</span>
have done what she did for me. I was an ignorant,
dirty, homeless creature and no relation of
hers, and yet she took charge of me, bought me
clothes, paid all my expenses going to Greenvale,
clothed me there, and always treated me nicely
without my even asking for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Frisbies certainly ran some risk by keeping
me at their cabin when they knew that half-breed
was after me. I don&#8217;t know why they should
have done all this. I was nothing to them. And
yet when I recall the night I stumbled into their
camp, how Mrs. Frisbie dressed me in her own
clothes, shared her tent with me, and even prayed
for me, I feel ashamed to think of what I have
done. I did think that Mrs. Frisbie despised me
from what Hannah said. I know now that I was
wrong, and running away as I did, was very ungrateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was, myself,&#8221; responded Aunt Abby,
&#8220;and yet believing as you did, Mrs. Frisbie ought
not to blame you. I don&#8217;t think she does, either.
She seems a very sensible woman, and I like her.
You made your mistake in not confiding in her
more. You should have gone to her as you would
to a mother, in the first place, and told her just
what Hannah had said to you and how you felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393'></a>393</span>
about it. To brood over such matters and imagine
the worst possible, is unwise in any one. I
think from what you have told me, that this person
who sneered against you so much must have had
a spite against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hannah was jealous, I know,&#8221; Chip interrupted,
smiling at the recollection, &#8220;and I hurt
her feelings because I asked her why she didn&#8217;t
shave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t shave!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Abby, wide-eyed,
&#8220;what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she has whiskers, you see,&#8221; laughed
Chip, &#8220;almost as much as some men&#8211;a nice
little mustache and some on her chin. I told
her the next day after I got there I thought she
was a man dressed as a woman. I snickered, too,
I remember, when I said it, for she looked so comical&#8211;like
a goat, almost&#8211;and then I asked her
why she didn&#8217;t shave. I guess she laid it up against
me ever after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She revenged herself amply, it seems,&#8221; answered
Aunt Abby.</p>

<p>When Christmas neared, and with it a vacation
for Chip, new impulses came to her: a desire to
visit Greenvale once more and make amends as
best she could to her friends there; and her gift-giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394'></a>394</span>
desire was quickened by the coming holidays.
She now felt that she had ample means to
gratify this latter wish. Day by day, since meeting
Angie again, her sense of obligation had increased,
and now it was in her power at Christmas-tide
to repay at least a little of the debt.</p>

<p>Others were also included in this generous project:
Uncle Jud, Aunt Mandy, her foster-mother,
Aunt Abby, as well; and then there was Old Cy,
whom most of all she now desired to make glad.
That was impossible, however. He was still an
absent wanderer, and so, as it ever is and ever
will be, some thread of regret, some note of sorrow,
must be woven into all joys.</p>

<p>A rapid and almost wonderful growth of this
yule-tide impulse now swept over Chip, so much
so that it must be told. At first it took shape in
the intended purchase of comparative trifles,&#8211;a
fishing-rod for Uncle Jud, a pipe for Martin, gloves
for Aunt Abby, and so on. Then as that seemingly
vast fortune, now hers to spend, occurred to
Chip, and her sense of obligation as well, the
intended gifts increased in proportion until a
costly picture of some camp or wildwood scene
for Angie and a valuable watch for Miss Phinney
were decided upon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395'></a>395</span>Her plans as to how to obtain these presents
also took shape. Riverton was the only place
where they could be obtained. To that village
she would go first, obtain the money needed, devote
one entire day to making her purchases, and
then go on to Greenvale and astonish these good
friends from whom she was once so eager to escape.</p>

<p>It was all a most delightful episode which was
now anticipated by Chip. Again and again she
lived it over, especially her arrival in Greenvale,
and how like a Lady Bountiful she would present
her gifts to her friends.</p>

<p>So eager was she thus to make some compensation
to them that lessons became irksome, the day
seemed weeks in length, and she could scarce sleep
when bedtime came.</p>

<p>But the slow days dragged by at last, and then
Chip, happier than ever before in her life, dressed
in her best, bade Aunt Abby good-bye and started
on her journey alone.</p>

&#8220;A man braggin&#8217; gits riled if ye try &#8217;n&#8217; choke him off.&#8221;
&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Riverton</span>, less provincial than Greenvale, was
a village of some two thousand inhabitants. A
few brick blocks, with less pretentious wooden
buildings, formed a nucleus of stores. A brownstone
bank, four churches, two hotels, the
Quaboag House and the Astor House were intermingled
among these, and a railroad with two
trains in each direction a day added life and interest
to the place. Each of the hotels sent a conveyance
to meet every train, with a loud-voiced
emissary to announce the fact of free transportation.
In each hostelry a bar flourished, and like
rival clubs, each had its afternoon and evening
gathering of loafers who swapped yarns and gossip,
smoked and chewed incessantly, and contributed
little else to support the establishments. Three
times daily, at meal hours, each of the rival landlords
banged a discordant gong in his front doorway,
without apparent result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397'></a>397</span>At about eleven in the forenoon each weekday
in summer, Uncle Joe Barnes on his lumbering
two-horse stage, arrived from Greenvale,
paused at the post-office, threw off a mail-pouch,
thence around to the Quaboag House stable, and
cared for his horses. At two he was ready for the
return trip and mounting his lofty seat, he again
drove to the front of the hotel, shouting &#8220;All
aboard!&#8221; dismounted to assist lady passengers,
but let masculine ones do their own climbing, and
after halting to receive a mail-bag, again departed
on his return trip.</p>

<p>A certain monotonous regularity was apparent
in every move and every act and function of village
life in Riverton. At precisely seven o&#8217;clock
each morning the two landlords appeared simultaneously
and banged their gongs. At twelve
and six, this was repeated. At eight o&#8217;clock the
three principal storekeepers usually entered their
places of business; at nine, and while the academy
bell was ringing near by, every village doctor might
be seen starting out. At ten exactly, Dwight
Bennett, the cashier of the bank, unlocked its
front door, and the two hotel &#8217;buses invariably
started so nearly together that they met at the first
turn going stationward. Even the four church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398'></a>398</span>
clocks had the same habit, and it was often related
that a stranger there, a travelling man, on his first,
visit, made an amusing discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a fool clock have you got in this
town?&#8221; he said to Sam Gates, the landlord of the
Quaboag, next morning after his arrival. &#8220;I
went to bed in good season last night an&#8217; just got
asleep when I heard it strike thirty-two. I dozed
off an&#8217; the next I knew it began clanging again,
and I counted forty-four. What sort of time do
you keep here, anyway? Do you run your town
by the multiplication table?&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-dozen chronic loafers who met every
afternoon in the Quaboag House office arrived
in about the same order, smoked, drank, told
their yarns, gathered all the gossip, and departed
at nearly the same moment. Their evening visits
partook of the same clocklike regularity.</p>

<p>These of the old guard were also dressed much
the same, and &#8220;slouchy&#8221; best describes it. Gray
flannel shirts in winter or summer alike. Collars,
cuffs, and ties were never seen on them, though
patches were, and as for shaving or hair-cutting,
a few shaved once a week, some never did, and
semi-annual hair-cuts were a fair average.</p>

<p>The worst sinner in this respect, Luke Atwater,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399'></a>399</span>
occasionally called &#8220;Lazy Luke,&#8221; never had his
beard shortened but once, and that was due to its
being burnt off while he was fighting a brush
fire in spring.</p>

<p>It was related of him, and believed by many,
that once upon a time many years previous he
had had his hair cut, and on that occasion the barber
had found a whetstone concealed in Luke&#8217;s
shock of tangled hair. It was also asserted that
he admitted always carrying his whetstone back
of his ear while mowing, and so losing it that way.</p>

<p>All the news and every happening in Riverton,
from the catching of an extra big trout to twins,
was duly commented upon and discussed by this
coterie. Village politics, how much money each
storekeeper was making, crop prospects, the run
of sap every spring, drouth, weather indications,
rain or snow falls, each and all formed rotating
subjects upon which every one of this faithful-to-the-post
clique expressed opinions.</p>

<p>Chip&#8217;s arrival there with the Frisbie family,
and her later history, learned from Uncle Joe,
furnished a fertile topic, her escapade in running
away from Greenvale a more exciting one, while
Old Cy&#8217;s visit and deposit of a fabulous sum in
the bank in her name had been a nine days&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400'></a>400</span>
wonder. That amount, hinted at only by the
cashier as a comfortable fortune, soon grew in
size until it was generally believed to be almost a
million.</p>

<p>This was Riverton and its decidedly rural status
when late one December afternoon the Quaboag
free &#8217;bus (a two-seated pung, this time) swept up
to that hotel&#8217;s front door, where the porter assisted
a stylish young lady to alight, and he, stepping
like a drum major, led the way into the Quaboag&#8217;s
unwarmed parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young lady, sir, a stunner, wants room over
night, sir,&#8221; he announced to the landlord in the
office a moment later. &#8220;Goin&#8217; to Greenvale
to-morrer, she says.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the instant all converse in the office ceased,
and the six constant callers hardly breathed until
Sam Gates hastened to the parlor and returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that McGuire gal&#8211;lady, I mean,&#8221; he
asserted pompously; then to the porter, &#8220;Git a
move on, Jim, &#8217;n&#8217; start a fire in Number 6, an&#8217;
quick, too!&#8221; And hastily brushing his untidy
hair before the office mirror, he left the room again,
followed by six envious glances. Then those astonished
loafers grouped themselves, the better
to observe the passage between parlor and office.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401'></a>401</span>Only one instant sight of this important guest
was obtained by them as Chip emerged from the
parlor and followed the landlord upstairs, and
then the hushed spell was broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gosh, it&#8217;s her!&#8221; exclaimed one in an awed
whisper, &#8220;an&#8217; Jim was right, she&#8217;s a stunner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;member jest how she looked that fust day
she came,&#8221; asserted another. &#8220;Saw her legs, too,
when she shinned up top o&#8217; the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye won&#8217;t git &#8217;nother chance, I&#8217;ll bet!&#8221; declared
a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do ye s&#8217;pose she&#8217;s here for,&#8221; queried a
fourth, &#8220;to draw the int&#8217;rest on her money, or
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was precisely four-forty-five when Chip appeared
before this judge and jury of all Riverton&#8217;s
happenings. At five-forty-five they had agreed
that she was the handsomest young lady who had
ever set foot in the town, that she must be going
to get married soon, and that her mission there
was to draw out a few thousand dollars for wedding
finery. Then they dispersed, and at six-forty-five,
when they assembled at the Quaboag again, half
of Riverton knew their conclusions, and by bedtime
all knew them.</p>

<p>By eight-thirty next morning, this all-observant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402'></a>402</span>
and all-wise clique had gathered in the hotel office
once more, an unusual proceeding, and when
Chip tripped out, eight pairs of eyes watched her
depart. Then they dispersed.</p>

<p>At nine o&#8217;clock Chip walked up the stone steps
to the bank door, read the legend, &#8220;Open from
10 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span> until 2 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span>,&#8221; turned away, and once more
resumed her leisurely stroll up and down the
street while she peered into store windows. At
ten precisely by the four church clocks she was
back at the bank again, and the cashier lost count
of the column he was adding when he saw her enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like three hundred dollars, if you
please, sir,&#8221; she said, presenting her little book,
and he had to count it over four times, to make
sure the amount was right. Then he passed the
thick bundle of currency out under his latticed
window, seeing only the two wide-open, fathomless
eyes and dimpled face that had watched him,
and feeling, as he afterward admitted, like fifty
cents.</p>

<p>And now ensued an experience the like of which
poor Chip had never even dreamed,&#8211;the supreme
joy of spending money without stint for those near
and dear to her. And what a medley of gifts she
bought! Two silk dress patterns, two warm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403'></a>403</span>
wraps, three winter hats, a gold watch for Miss
Phinney, an easy-chair, two of the finest pipes
she could find, a trout rod, four pairs of gloves,
and finally a gun for Nezer. Then as her roll
of money grew less, she began to pick up smaller
articles,&#8211;handkerchiefs, slippers, and the like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send them to the hotel, please,&#8221; she said to
one and all of whom she purchased articles of any
size, &#8220;marked for Vera McGuire.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was enough!</p>

<p>Riverton had sensations, mild ones, of course.
Now and then a fire had occurred, once an elopement.
Occasionally a horse ran away, causing
damage to some one. But nothing had occurred to
compare with the arrival of a supposed fabulously
rich young lady who came without escort, who
walked into and out of stores like a young goddess,
noticing no one, and who spent money as if it were
autumn leaves.</p>

<p>A few of the Quaboag retinue followed her about
in a not-to-be-observed manner. Women by the
dozen hastily donned outdoor raiment, and visited
stores, just to observe her. They crossed and recrossed
the street to meet her, and a battery of
curious eyes was focussed on her for two hours.</p>

<p>When she returned to the hotel, the old guard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404'></a>404</span>
recruited by every idle man in town, filled the office,
awaiting her. Uncle Joe, who had heard of her
arrival the moment he came, was among them, recounting
her history once more, and when she neared
the hotel, he emerged to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless yer eyes, Chip,&#8221; he said, extending a
calloused hand, &#8220;but I&#8217;m powerful glad to see ye
once more. Whatever made ye run away the way
ye did, &#8217;n&#8217; what be ye doin&#8217; here? Buyin&#8217; out the
hull town? I&#8217;ve got the pung filled wi&#8217; bundles
a&#8217;ready wi&#8217; yer name on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>He beaued her into the parlor, like the ancient
gallant he was. He washed, brushed his hair and
clothing, and awaited her readiness to dine, without
holding further converse with the curious crowd.
He ushered her into the dining room and made bold
to sit and eat with her unasked, and when he assisted
her to the front seat in his long box sleigh, crowded
with her purchases, and drove away, he was envied
by two dozen observers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t ye send us word o&#8217; yer comin&#8217;,&#8221; he
said as they left Riverton, &#8220;so I cud &#8217;a&#8217; spruced up
some an&#8217; come down with a better rig, bells on the
hosses and new buffler robes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no need of that,&#8221; answered Chip,
pleased, as well she might be. &#8220;I am just the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405'></a>405</span>
girl that I always was, only happier now that I have
more friends. How is dear old Aunt Comfort, and
every one in Greenvale? I am anticipating seeing
them so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>And never during all the twenty years in which
Uncle Joe had journeyed twice each day over this
road had the way seemed shorter, or had he been
blessed with a more interesting companion.</p>

<p>The only regret Chip had, was that she had forgotten
to buy Uncle Joe a present. She made up for
it later, however.</p>

<p>At Greenvale, Chip met almost an ovation. Aunt
Comfort kissed her and cried over her. Nezer ran
for Angie, who soon appeared on the scene, and
Hannah was so &#8220;flustered&#8221; she was unable to speak
after the first greeting. Martin, who had heard of
Chip&#8217;s arrival from Uncle Joe, hastened to Aunt
Comfort&#8217;s, and had Chip been a real &#8220;millionnairess&#8221;
or some titled lady, she could not have awakened
more interest or received half so cordial a welcome.</p>

<p>Hannah was the one who felt the most embarrassed,
however, and guilty as well. For half an
hour, while Chip was the centre of interest, she
could only stare at her in dumb amazement. Then
she stole out of the room, and later Chip found her
in the kitchen, shedding copious tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406'></a>406</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m a miserable sinner &#8217;n&#8217; the Lord&#8217;ll never
forgive me,&#8221; she half moaned, when Chip tried to
console her. &#8220;An&#8217; to think ye feel the way ye say,
&#8217;n&#8217; to bring me a present, arter all the mean things
I said. It&#8217;s a-heapin&#8217; coals o&#8217; fire on my head, that
it is.&#8221; And the shower increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have forgotten all about them, Hannah, truly
I have,&#8221; Chip assured her, &#8220;and I wish you would.
You didn&#8217;t understand me then, perhaps, or I you,
so let us be friends now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next afternoon Chip, who had learned that
Miss Phinney&#8217;s school was to close the day following,
set out to call on her in time to arrive at its adjournment.</p>

<p>No hint of her return had reached Miss Phinney,
no letters had been exchanged, and not since that
tearful separation had they met.</p>

<p>And now as Chip followed the lonely by-road so
often traversed by her, what a flood of bitter-sweet
memories returned,&#8211;each bend, each tree, each
rock, and the bridge over the Mizzy held a different
recollection. Here at this turn she had first met
Ray, after her resolve to leave Greenvale. At the
next landmark, a lane crossing the meadows, she
had always parted from her teacher, the last time in
tears. And how long, long ago it all seemed!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407'></a>407</span>Then beyond, and barely visible, was the dear
old schoolhouse. She could see it now, half hid in
the bushes, a lone and lowly little brown building
outlined on the winter landscape and apparently
dwarfed in size. Once it had awed her; now it
seemed pathetic.</p>

<p>The last of its pupils were vanishing as Chip drew
near, and inside, and as lonely as that lone temple,
Miss Phinney still lingered.</p>

<p>That day had not gone well with her. A note of
complaint had come from one parent that morning,
and news that a dearly loved scholar was ill as well,
and Miss Phinney&#8217;s own life seemed like the fields
just now&#8211;cold, desolate, and snow-covered.</p>

<p>And then while she, thus lone and lonesome, was
putting away books, slates, ink-bottles, and all the
badges of her servitude, Chip, without knocking,
walked in.</p>

<p>How they first exclaimed, then embraced, then
kissed, and then repeated it while each tried to wink
the tears away, and failed; how they sat hand in
hand in that dingy, smoke-browned room with its
knife-hacked benches, unconscious of the chill,
while Chip told her story; and how, just as the
last rays of the setting sun flashed from the icicles
along its eaves, they left it, still hand in hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408'></a>408</span>
was but an episode such as many a schoolgirl can
recall.</p>

<p>Of the few friends Greenvale held for Chip, none
seemed quite so near and dear as Miss Phinney,
and none lived longer in her memory. They had
been for many months not teacher and pupil, but
rather two sisters, confiding, patient, and tender.
Life swept them apart. They might never meet
again, and yet, so long as both lived, never would
those school days be forgotten.</p>

<p>With Sunday came Chip&#8217;s most gratifying experience,
perhaps, for her arrival was now known
by the entire village and the fact that she was an
heiress as well. Her fortune (also known) was
considered almost fabulous according to Greenvale
standards, and when Chip with Angie entered
the church porch, it was crowded with people
waiting to receive them. Chip, of course, now well
clad and well poised, was once more the cynosure
of all eyes except when the pastor prayed. At the
close of service a score, most of whom she knew by
sight only, waited to greet her and shake hands with
her in the porch. The parson hurried down the
aisle to add his smile and hand clasp, and, all in all,
it was a most gratifying reception.</p>

<p>And here and now, let no carping critic say it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409'></a>409</span>
all due to that bank account, but rather a country
town&#8217;s expression of respect and good-will toward
one whom they felt deserved it.</p>

<p>That it all pleased Angie, goes without saying.
That Chip well deserved this vindication, no one
will question; and when her visit ended and she departed,
no one, not even Miss Phinney, missed her
more than Angie.</p>

<p>Only one thread of regret wove itself into Chip&#8217;s
feelings as she rode away with Uncle Joe, whose
horses were now decked properly for this important
event. She had received a most cordial reception
on all sides&#8211;almost a triumph of good-will. Her
gifts had brought an oft-repeated chorus of thanks
and a few tears. On all sides and among all she
had been welcome, even receiving a call and words
of praise from Parson Jones. She was a <i>nobody</i> no
longer; instead, a <i>somebody</i> whom all delighted to
honor and commend.</p>

<p>But the one whose motherly pride would have been
most gratified, she for whom Chip&#8217;s heart yearned
for oftenest, would never know it.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410'></a>410</span><a id='link_40'></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>With</span> the birds and flowers once more returning
to Christmas Cove, came outdoor freedom for Chip
again. Like the wood-nymph she was in character
and taste, the wild, rock-bound coast outside and the
low, wooded mountain enclosing this village were
her playgrounds where she found companionship.
Other associates she cared but little for, and a few
hours alone on a wave-washed shore, watching the
wild ocean billows tossing spray aloft, or a long
ramble in a deep, silent forest, appealed to her far
more than parties and girlish enjoyments.</p>

<p>The wood-bordered road, leading from the village
to the railroad ten miles away, was now a favorite
walk of hers. It was suited to her in many ways,
for it was seldom travelled; it followed the sunny
side of the low mountain range back of Christmas
Cove, not a house stood along its entire way, and to
add charm, a brook kept it company, crossing and
recrossing it for two miles. That feature was the
most especial attraction, for beds of watercress
waved beneath the limpid waters in deep pools,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411'></a>411</span>
bunches of flag grew along its banks, their blue
flowers bending to kiss the current; its ripples
danced in the sunlight; its music was a tinkling
melody, and these simple attractions appealed to
Chip.</p>

<p>There was also another reason for now choosing
this byway walk. She knew, or felt sure, that Ray
would visit Christmas Cove on his return from the
woods. He must come in the old carryall,&#8211;about
the only vehicle ever journeying along this road,&#8211;and
now, like a brownie of the forest, she watched
until she spied it afar and then hid in the bushes
and peeped out until it passed each day.</p>

<p>A curious and somewhat complex feeling toward
this young man had also come to her. At first,
like a child, she had loved him unasked. She had
known no different. He had seemed like a young
god to her, and to cling to him was supreme happiness.
Then had come an awakening, a consciousness
that this freedom was not right and must be
checked. Following that also&#8211;a bitter lesson&#8211;it
had come to her that she was a kind of outcast,
a child of shame, as it were, whose origin was despicable,
and who was dependent upon the charity
of others. This awakening, this new consciousness,
was like a black chasm in front of her, a horror and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412'></a>412</span>
shame combined, and true to her nature, she fled
from it like one pursued.</p>

<p>But two years had changed her views of humanity.
She had learned that money and social position did
not always win friends and respect. That birth and
ancestry were of less consideration than a pure mind
and honest intentions, and that fine raiment sometimes
covered a base heart and vile nature.</p>

<p>Toward this boyish lover, also, her feelings had
been altered. A little of the old-time fondness
remained, however. She could not put that away.
She had tried and tried earnestly, yet the wildwood
illusion still lingered. She had meant, also, to put
him and herself quite apart&#8211;so far, and in such a
way, that she would never be found by him. That
had failed, however; he knew where she was. He
had said that he was coming here. Most likely he
would expect to renew the old tender relations; but in
that he would be disappointed. She was sure she
would be glad to see him for old times&#8217; sake, however.
She would be gracious and dignified, as Aunt Abby
was. She wanted to hear all about the woods and
Old Cy again, but caresses must be forbidden.
More than that, every time she recalled how freely
she had permitted them once, she blushed and felt
that it would be an effort to look him in the face again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413'></a>413</span>But she was anxious to see how he would appear
now: whether the same boy, with frank, open face,
or a commanding, self-possessed man.</p>

<p>And so each pleasant afternoon she strolled up
this byway road. When the ancient carryall was
sighted, she hid and watched until it passed.</p>

<p>But Captain Mix, its driver, also had observing
eyes. He knew her now as far as he could see her,
as every one in the village did, and he soon noticed
her unusual conduct. He also watched along the
wayside where she left it, and slyly observed her
peeping out from some thicket. Just why this odd
proceeding happened time and again, he could not
guess, and not until a strange young man alighted
from the train one day and asked to be left at the
home of Mrs. Abby Bemis, did it dawn on him.</p>

<p>Then he laughed. &#8220;Friend o&#8217; Aunt Abby, I
&#8217;spose?&#8221; he inquired in his Yankee fashion, after
they had started.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Ray, frankly, &#8220;I have never seen
the lady. I know some one who is living with her,
however. A Miss Mc&#8211;Raymond, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mix glanced at him, his eyes twinkling.
&#8220;So ye&#8217;re &#8217;quainted with Vera, be ye,&#8221; he responded.
&#8220;Wal, ye&#8217;re lucky.&#8221; Then as curiosity grew he
added, &#8220;Known her quite a spell, hev ye?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414'></a>414</span>But Ray was discreet. &#8220;Oh, three or four years,&#8221;
he answered nonchalantly. &#8220;I knew her when she
lived in Greenvale.&#8221; Then to check the stage-driver&#8217;s
curiosity, he added, &#8220;She was only a little
girl, then. I presume she has changed since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a purty good-lookin&#8217; gal now,&#8221; asserted
Captain Mix, &#8220;but middlin&#8217; odd in her ways. Not
much on gallivantin&#8217; round wi&#8217; young folks, but
goin&#8217; to school stiddy &#8217;n&#8217; roamin&#8217; round the woods
when she ain&#8217;t. Purty big gal to be goin&#8217; to school
she is. I callate her arly eddication must &#8217;a&#8217; been
sorter neglected. Mebbe ye know &#8217;bout it,&#8221; and
once more this persistent Yankee glanced at his
companion.</p>

<p>But Ray was too loyal to the little girl he loved to
discuss her further, and made no answer. Instead,
he began inquiries about Christmas Cove, and as
they jogged on mile after mile, he learned all that
was to be known of that quiet village. When they
had reached a point some three miles from it, a
kindly thought came to the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Vera ain&#8217;t &#8217;spectin&#8217; ye,&#8221; he said, &#8220;mebbe ye&#8217;d
like to s&#8217;prise her. If so be it, ye kin. She&#8217;s &#8217;most
allus out this way &#8217;n&#8217;, curislike, hides &#8217;fore I get
&#8217;long whar she is. If I see her to-day, &#8217;n&#8217; ye want to,
I&#8217;ll drop ye clus by &#8217;n&#8217; let ye.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415'></a>415</span>And so it came to pass.</p>

<p>Chip, as usual, had followed her oft-taken walk
on this pleasant May afternoon. When the carryall
was sighted also, as usual, she had hidden herself.
With beating heart she saw two occupants this time,
and looking out of her laurel screen, she saw that
one was Ray.</p>

<p>Then she crouched lower. The moment she had
waited for had come.</p>

<p>But now something unexpected happened, for after
the carryall passed her hiding spot, Ray, brown and
stalwart, leaped out. The carryall drove on, and
she saw him returning and scanning the bushes.</p>

<p>She was caught, fairly and squarely. One instant
she hesitated, then, blushing rose-red, emerged
from the undergrowth.</p>

<p>And now came another capture, for with a &#8220;Chip,
my darling,&#8221; Ray sprang forward, and although
she turned away, the next moment she was clasped
in his arms.</p>

<p>In vain she struggled. In vain she writhed and
twisted. In vain she pushed him away and then
covered her blushing face.</p>

<p>Love, fierce and eager, could not be thus opposed.
All her pride, anger, resentment, shame, and intended
coldness were as so many straws, for despite her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416'></a>416</span>
struggles, he pulled her hands aside and kissed her
again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling,&#8221; he exclaimed at last, &#8220;say you
forgive me; say you love me; say it now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as she drew away, he saw her eyes were
brimming with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I hate&#8211;&#8221; but his lips cut
the sentence in two, and it was never finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did mean to hate you,&#8221; she declared once more,
covering her face, &#8220;but I&#8211;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; he asserted eagerly, &#8220;for I won&#8217;t
let you. You promised to love me once, and now
you&#8217;ve got to, for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she did.</p>

<p>When the outburst of emotion had subsided and
they strolled homeward, Chip glanced shyly up at
her lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you pounce on me so?&#8221; she queried;
&#8220;why didn&#8217;t you ask me, first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;a wise man kisses the
girl first, and asks her afterwards.&#8221; Then he repeated
the offence.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;I did mean to hate you, but I&#8211;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417'></a>417</span>And now what a charming summer of sweet illusion
and castle-building followed for the lovers!
How Aunt Abby smiled benignly upon them, quite
content to accord ample chance for wooing! How
many blissful, dreamy hours they passed on lonely
wave-washed cliffs, while the marvel of love was discussed!
How its wondrous magic opened a new
world whose walks were flower-decked, whose sky
was ever serene, where lilies bloomed, birds sang,
sea winds whispered of time and eternity, and where
Chip was an adored queen! How all the shame and
humiliation of her past life faded away and joy
supreme entered on the azure and golden wings of
this new morning! Even Old Cy was almost forgotten;
the spites, Old Tomah, and Tim&#8217;s Place
quite so; and all hope, all joy, all protection, and all
her future centred in the will and wishes of this
Prince Perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blind and foolish,&#8221; I hear some fair critic say.
Yes, more than that, almost idiotic; for selfish man
never pursues unless forced to do so, and an object
of worship once possessed, is but a summer flower.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418'></a>418</span><a id='link_41'></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<div class='cyquote'>
&#8220;A man&#8217;ll hev all the friends he kin keer for if he tends to
his own knittin&#8217; work.&#8221;&#8211;<span class='sc'>Old Cy Walker</span>.
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Quite</span> different from the meeting of the lovers was
that which occurred when Old Cy reached Peaceful
Valley. There were no heroics, no falling upon one
another&#8217;s necks, no tears. Just a &#8220;Hullo, Cyrus!&#8221;
&#8220;Hullo, Judson!&#8221; as these two brothers clasped
hands, and forty years were bridged.</p>

<p>Aunt Mandy, however, showed more emotion, for
when Old Cy rather awkwardly stooped to kiss her,
the long ago of Sister Abby&#8217;s sorrow welled up in her
heart, and the tears came.</p>

<p>That evening&#8217;s reunion, with its two life histories
to be exchanged, did not close until the
tall clock had ticked time into the wee, small hours.</p>

<p>All of Old Cy&#8217;s almost marvellous adventures had
to be told by him, and not the least interesting were
the last few years at the wilderness home of the
hermit. Chip&#8217;s entry into it and her history formed
another chapter fully as thrilling, with Uncle Jud&#8217;s
rescue of her for a <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419'></a>419</span>The most pathetic feature of this intermingled
history&#8211;the years while sweet Abby Grey waited
and watched for her lover&#8211;was left untold. Only
once was it referred to by Aunt Mandy, in an indirect
way; but the quick lowering of Old Cy&#8217;s eyes and the
shadow that overspread his face, checked her at
once. Almost intuitively she realized its unwisdom,
and that it was a sorrow best not referred to.</p>

<p>Old Cy evidently felt it a subject to avoid, and not
until the next day did he even ask how Aunt Abby
looked or what had been her life experiences. A
little of this reticence wore away in due time, however,
and then Aunt Mandy once more referred to
her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kinder feel you blame Abby somehow, Cyrus,
the way you act,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and yet thar ain&#8217;t no
cause for it. She&#8217;d waited &#8217;most seven years. We&#8217;d
all given you up for dead, and life in Christmas Cove
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t promisin&#8217; much for Abby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame her a mite,&#8221; Old Cy answered
quickly, &#8220;an&#8217; no need o&#8217; yer thinkin&#8217; so. I don&#8217;t
blame no woman fer makin&#8217; the best shift they kin.
They&#8217;ve got to hev a home &#8217;n&#8217; pertecter, bless &#8217;em,
or be nobody in this world. Comin&#8217; here and findin&#8217;
how things are, sorter makes me realize how much
I&#8217;ve missed in life, though, an&#8217; how much sorrer I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420'></a>420</span>
had to outgrow. I don&#8217;t lay up nothin&#8217; &#8217;gainst
Abby, not fer a minit. Only I hated to hev ye tell
me what I knew ye&#8217;d hev to, that fust night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to see her, ain&#8217;t ye, Cyrus?&#8221;
Aunt Mandy asked anxiously. &#8220;Ye won&#8217;t shame
her by not goin&#8217;, will ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe,&#8221; he answered slowly, and after a
long pause. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to hurt her knowin&#8217;ly.
I callate I&#8217;ve done more grievin&#8217;n she has, though,
ten times over, an&#8217; seein&#8217; her now&#8217;s a good deal like
openin&#8217; an old tomb&#8211;a sorter invitin&#8217; ghosts o&#8217;
old heartaches to step out. Abby&#8217;s outgrowed the
old times, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;m sartin, too, won&#8217;t be the happier
by seein&#8217; me ag&#8217;in. I may be wrong, but I&#8217;ve a notion
she&#8217;ll sorter hate to see me. &#8217;Twas to keep her from
feelin&#8217; &#8217;shamed &#8217;n&#8217; miserable &#8217;n&#8217; spoilin&#8217; her life, I&#8217;ve
never let her nor nobody that knew her find out I
was alive. I&#8217;m doubtin&#8217; I would now if she hadn&#8217;t
larned it from Chip.&#8221;</p>

<p>He relented a little from this strange and almost
cruel whim a week later, and after visiting the Riggsville
store and obtaining what really amounted to a
disguise in new garments, he announced his plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to see Chip,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; see how she
&#8217;n&#8217; Ray&#8217;s gittin&#8217; on. I&#8217;ve got to see Abby, I s&#8217;pose.
I want to, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t want to, both in one. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421'></a>421</span>
ag&#8217;in, these two young folks&#8211;Chip &#8217;n&#8217; the boy&#8211;hev
sorter got tangled up in my feelin&#8217;s, &#8217;n&#8217; I can&#8217;t
rest content till I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em settled in life. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to Christmas Cove fer a day. Then back here
till they hitch up, &#8217;n&#8217; then&#8211;wal, then mebbe I&#8217;d
better go to the woods ag&#8217;in. I ain&#8217;t fitted by natur
fer dressed-up folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>No opposition to this unseemly outcome was
made by Uncle Jud or Aunt Mandy. They knew,
or hoped, the leaven of bygone memories and association
would change the hermit-like impulse of Old
Cy, and all in good time a better ending of his life
would seem possible to him. To argue it now was
apparently useless. A man so set in his ideas as to
remain a homeless wanderer for almost a lifetime, was
not to be changed in a month, or perhaps in a year.</p>

<p>Neither did Old Cy seem in a hurry to visit Christmas
Cove.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look nat&#8217;ral or feel nat&#8217;ral in them new
clothes,&#8221; he said to Aunt Mandy one day, &#8220;an&#8217;
while I want to see Abby, I&#8217;ve lived in the woods so
long I&#8217;m sorter &#8217;shamed to go &#8217;mongst respectable
people. Then I look like one o&#8217; them wooden men
dressed up in a store winder with that new rig on, an&#8217;
jest know folks&#8217;ll all be laughin&#8217; at me. I&#8217;ve got to
go, I callate, but I&#8217;d like to make the trip in a cage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422'></a>422</span>
I&#8217;m sartin sure Abby&#8217;ll laugh at me arterwards.&#8221;
From which it may be seen how hard it was for
Old Cy to fit himself into civilized life once more.</p>

<p>He nerved himself for the trip to Christmas Cove
in a few days, however, and how he met and renewed
acquaintance with his old-time sweetheart shall be
told in his own words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abby hain&#8217;t changed near so much as I callated,&#8221;
he said on his return; &#8220;a leetle fuller in figger, but
jest the same easy-spoken, sweet sorter woman I
always knew she&#8217;d be. She was &#8217;lone when I called,
an&#8217; fer a minit arter we shook hands neither on us
could speak ag&#8217;in. Then she kinder bit her lip &#8217;n&#8217;
swallered her feelin&#8217;s, keepin&#8217; her face turned away,
an&#8217; then we sot down &#8217;n&#8217; begun talkin&#8217;. It was
techin&#8217;, too, the way she acted, fer she kept tryin&#8217; to
smile, &#8217;n&#8217; all the while the tears kept startin&#8217;. It
was like one o&#8217; them summer days when the rain
patters while the sun is shinin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t think she
noticed my clothes much, either, an&#8217; we sot up till
&#8217;most midnight talkin&#8217; over old times. It all turned
out &#8217;bout the way I &#8217;spected&#8211;a sorter funeral o&#8217;
old hopes with us two fer mourners. She&#8217;s powerful
considerate, too, Abby is, for all the time we was
talkin&#8217; she never once spoke o&#8217; Cap&#8217;n Bemis, &#8217;n&#8217; I
didn&#8217;t. It was jest ez if we started in whar we left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423'></a>423</span>
off, &#8217;n&#8217; skippin&#8217; the gap between. She &#8217;lowed she
hoped she&#8217;d see me soon ag&#8217;in, that she felt like a
mother to Chip; an&#8217; when I bid her good-bye, she
kinder choked once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see much o&#8217; Chip, either, which sorter
hurt me. Take it all in all, my visit thar upsot me
more&#8217;n I callated, &#8217;n&#8217; I guess when Chip&#8217;s settled,
I&#8217;d best go to the woods &#8217;n&#8217; forgit all that&#8217;s past.
My life&#8217;s been a failure, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Old Cy was right; but it was grim and merciless
Fate that made it so, and for that he was not
responsible.</p>

<p>Love in youth is a sweet song of joy and hope and
promise. But love that spans a lifetime, that
reaches and caresses our heartstrings once again as
we enter the final shadows, has only the pathos of
parting and the tender chords of almost forgotten
melodies in it. Vainly do we strive to enter the enchanted
garden once more. Vainly do our heart
throbs beat against its adamant walls. Vainly do
we hope to catch just one more of the old bygone
thrills. It is useless, for none can live life over, and
once age has locked the portals of youth and fervor,
they are never opened again.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424'></a>424</span><a id='link_42'></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<p><span class='sc'>With</span> September came a supreme event in the
lives of Chip and Ray, when Mr. and Mrs. Frisbie,
Aunt Comfort, Miss Phinney and Hannah, Uncle
Jud and Aunt Mandy, and Old Cy, all gathered in
Aunt Abby&#8217;s quaint parlor to see her aged pastor
join their hands and lives. Then came the kisses,
the congratulations, the rice, and old-shoe throwing,
and then solitude and tears for Aunt Abby. All
the wedding guests except Old Cy hied themselves
away with the new pair, and he left for
Bayport.</p>

<p>And thus closes the history of Chip McGuire, waif
of the wilderness and slave of Tim&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>Bless her!</p>

<p>Two days later Old Cy returned.</p>

<p>No one was in the house when he knocked at Aunt
Abby&#8217;s door, and then, led perhaps by the invisible
chord that spanned forty years, he slowly strolled
up the path beside the old mill-pond, which he and
she had often followed in the old, old days.</p>

<p>His heart had led him aright, for there, at the foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425'></a>425</span>
of the ancient oak that had once been their trysting-place,
she sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d come over &#8217;n&#8217; bid ye good-bye,
Abby,&#8221; he said gently, as she arose to meet him.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doin&#8217; a good deal o&#8217; biddin&#8217; good-bye
to-day. I bid good-bye to the old graveyard whar
my folks is; it&#8217;s all growed up to weeds &#8217;n&#8217; bushes,
I&#8217;m sorry to say. But that can&#8217;t be helped. It&#8217;s
the way o&#8217; natur. I&#8217;ve been down to the p&#8217;int whar
you &#8217;n&#8217; I used to go, an&#8217; I bid that good-bye,&#8221; he
added, seating himself near her. &#8220;Ye &#8217;member it,
don&#8217;t ye, Abby, &#8217;n&#8217; them days when we went thar to
watch the waves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, Cyrus,&#8221; she answered, her voice trembling.
&#8220;I remember all the old days only too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all come back to me, too,&#8221; he continued in
a lower tone, &#8220;an&#8217; I wish I could skip back to &#8217;em,
but I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m an old man now, an&#8217; no use to
nobody, &#8217;n&#8217; not much to myself. I&#8217;ve been a wanderer
many years&#8211;ye know why, Abby. I&#8217;ve had
a short spell o&#8217; joy, kinder helpin&#8217; this boy &#8217;n&#8217; gal
into sunshine &#8217;n&#8217; a home. They&#8217;ve gone their way
now &#8217;n&#8217; sure to forgit me an&#8217; you. It&#8217;s nat&#8217;ral they
should, &#8217;n&#8217; all that&#8217;s left me is to go back to the
woods &#8217;n&#8217; stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, glancing up the narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426'></a>426</span>
pond to where it ended in shadow, and then continued:
&#8220;It&#8217;s curis, Abby, how life begins with
how-de-do&#8217;s &#8217;n&#8217; smilin&#8217; friends &#8217;n&#8217; cheerin&#8217; prospects,
&#8217;n&#8217; then ends with good-byes &#8217;n&#8217; bein&#8217; forgot.
It&#8217;s what we must callate on, though, an&#8217; a good deal
like a graveyard is left to weeds and bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he paused, closed his eyes, and remained
silent for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I might as well be goin&#8217;,&#8221; he said finally,
rising and extending his hand, &#8220;so good-bye, Abby.
I wish ye well in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is there any need of it?&#8221; she answered,
turning her face to hide the tears as his hand clasped
hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, only to fergit my sorrer,&#8221; he answered;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who will care for you there&#8211;at last&#8211;and&#8211;must you go?&#8221; Then she turned to him again.</p>

<p>And then he saw, not the gentle, saddened face
upraised to his, but the tender face of sweet Abby
Grey of the long, long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must you leave us&#8211;me?&#8221; she whispered once
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe not,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>THE CALL OF THE WILD:</p>

<p>With illustrations by Philip R. Goodwin and Charles Livingston
Bull. Decorated by Charles Edward Hooper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A big story in sober English, and with thorough art in the
construction ... a wonderfully perfect bit of work. The dog
adventures are as exciting as any man&#8217;s exploits could be, and
Mr. London&#8217;s workmanship is wholly satisfying.&#8221;&#8211;<i>The New
York Sun.</i></p>

<p>THE SEA WOLF: Illustrated by W. J. Aylward.</p>

<p>&#8220;This story surely has the pure Stevenson ring, the adventurous
glamour, the vertebrate stoicism. &#8217;Tis surely the story
of the making of a man, the sculptor being Captain Larsen,
and the clay, the ease-loving, well-to-do, half-drowned man,
to all appearances his helpless prey.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Critic.</i></p>

<p>THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS:</p>

<p>A vivid and intensely interesting picture of life, as the author
found it, in the slums of London. Not a survey of impressions
formed on a slumming tour, but a most graphic account
of real life from one who succeeded in getting on the
&#8220;inside.&#8221; More absorbing than a novel. A great and vital
book. Profusely illustrated from photographs.</p>

<p>THE SON OF THE WOLF:</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the most listless reader will be stirred by the virile
force, the strong, sweeping strokes with which the pictures of
the northern wilds and the life therein are painted, and the insight
given into the soul of the primitive of nature.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Plain,
Dealer, Cleveland.</i></p>

<p>A DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS:</p>

<p>It is a book about a woman, whose personality and plan in
the story are likely to win for her a host of admirers. The
story has the rapid movement, incident and romantic flavor
which have interested so many in his tales. The illustrations
are by F. C. Yohn.</p>

gained for it the title of &#8220;The &#8216;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#8217; of

<p>Suggestions for the Utilizing of Home
Grounds. 12 mo., cloth, 350 illustrations.</p>

<p>Here is a book literally &#8220;for the million&#8221; who in broad
America have some love for growing things. It is useful alike
to the owner of a suburban garden plot and to the owner of a
&#8220;little place&#8221; in the country. Written by the Professor of
Horticulture at Cornell University it tells of ornamental gardening
of any range, treats of fruits and vegetables for home
use, and cannot fail to instruct, inspire and educate the reader.</p>

<p>THE PRACTICAL GARDEN BOOK, by C. E.
Hunn and L. H. Bailey.</p>

<p>Containing the simplest directions for growing the commonest
things about the house and garden. Profusely illustrated.
12 mo., cloth. Just the book for the busy man or woman who
wants the most direct practical information as to just how to
plant, prune, train and to care for all the common fruits, flowers,
vegetables, or ornamental bushes and trees. Arranged alphabetically,
like a minature encyclopedia, it has articles on the
making of lawns, borders, hot-beds, window gardening, lists of
plants for particular purposes, etc.</p>

Rutherfurd Ely. With forty-nine illustrations
from photographs taken in the author&#8217;s
garden by Prof. C. F. Chandler. 12 mo., cloth.</p>

<p>A superbly illustrated volume, appealing especially to the
many men and women whose love of flowers and all things
green is a passion so strong that it often seems to be a sort of
primal instinct, coming down through generation after generation
from the first man who was put into a garden &#8220;to dress it
and keep it.&#8221; The instructions as to planting, maintenance,
etc., are clear and comprehensive, and can be read and practiced
with profit by both amateur and professional.</p>

<p>BREWSTER&#8217;S MILLIONS</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomery Brewster is required to spend a million
dollars in one year in order to inherit seven millions. He must
be absolutely penniless at that time, and yet have spent the
million in a way that will commend him as fit to inherit the
larger sum. How he does it forms the basis for one of the
most crisp and breezy romances of recent years.</p>

<p>CASTLE CRANEYCROW</p>

<p>The story revolves around the abduction of a young American
woman and the adventures created through her rescue.
The title is taken from the name of an old castle on the Continent,
the scene of her imprisonment.</p>

<p>GRAUSTARK: A Story of a Love Behind a Throne.</p>

<p>This work has been and is to-day one of the most popular
works of fiction of this decade. The meeting of the Princess
of Graustark with the hero, while travelling incognito in this
country, his efforts to find her, his success, the defeat of conspiracies
to dethrone her, and their happy marriage, provide
entertainment which every type of reader will enjoy.</p>

<p>A novel quite unlike Mr. McCutcheon&#8217;s previous works in
the field of romantic fiction and yet possessing the charm inseparable
from anything he writes. The scene is laid in Indiana

<p class='c fs14'>A LITTLE BOOK <i>of</i><br />TRIBUNE VERSE</p>
<p class='c'><i>By</i> EUGENE FIELD</p>

<p>Compiled and edited by Joseph G. Brown, formerly
city editor of the  Denver Tribune, and an intimate friend
and associate of the poet during the several years in which
he was on the staff of that paper.</p>

<p>This volume resurrects a literary treasure which has
been buried for many years in the forgotten files of a
newspaper, and it is, as nearly as it has been possible to
make, an absolutely complete collection of the hitherto
unpublished poems of the gifted author.</p>

<p>These poems are the early product of Field&#8217;s genius.
They breathe the spirit of Western life of twenty years ago.
The reckless cowhoy, the bucking broncho, the hardy
miner, the English tenderfoot, the coquettish belle, and all
the foibles and extravagance of Western social life, are depicted
with a naivete and satire, tempered with sympathy
and pathos, which no other writer could imitate.</p>

<p>The book contains nearly three hundred pages, including
an interesting and valuable introduction by the
editor, and is printed from new type on fine deckle edge
paper, and hand omely bound in cloth, with gilt tops.</p>

<p>THE PILLAR OF LIGHT</p>

<p>&#8220;Breathless interest&#8221; is a hackneyed phrase, but every
reader of &#8220;The Pillar of Light&#8221; who has red blood in
his or her veins, will agree that the trite saying applies to
the attention which this story commands.&#8211;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>THE WINGS OF THE MORNING</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a story filled with the swing of adventure.
There are no dragging intervals in this volume: from the
moment of their landing on the island until the rescuing
crew find them there, there is not a dull moment for the
young people&#8211;nor for the reader either.&#8221;&#8211;<i> New York
Times.</i></p>

<p>THE KING OF DIAMONDS</p>

<p>Verily, Mr. Tracy is a prince of story-tellers. His
charm it a little hard to describe, but it is as definite as
that of a rainbow. The reader is carried along by the
robust imagination of the author.&#8211;<i>San Francisco Examiner.</i></p>
